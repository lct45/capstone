finding work with pending name change  transgender,gender identity,missblit,2,1,0,neutral,3,1432702400,i recently graduated with a bs in cs    i m also transgender  and my diploma will be under my  old  name  all my legal documents too  not to mention the name on the page for my cool capstone project that i d like to show off   i m going to work on getting a name change  yes  i should have done this earlier  but it s a time consuming  over six weeks in the best case  expensive  and kinda confusing process   in the meanwhile  i m not totally sure how i should approach looking for a job  since presumably employers will want to do background checks and degree verification and all that good stuff     would it be better to use legal or actual name on resume    should i put a note about it one or the other    should i just avoid the issue entirely and act like a well endowed feminine guy or something    etc   i appreciate any thoughts   i ve also already read the  other thread about transgender stuff http www reddit com r cscareerquestions comments xdob difficulty for transgender or gender  but if anyone has some other thoughts about that all i d love to hear them as well
starting a new job when i know i might have to move next year  am i doing the right thing,gender identity,__cscq_throwaway,0,3,1,neutral,4,1466128787,i got laid off in march and have been on unemployment since  multiple attempts to find a new job failed  many of them in frustrating ways  last month  one of my best friends  who i went to college with and have known for over a decade  suggested that i apply for a job at his company  i looked at the description  and it sounds like my dream job  i looked the company up on glassdoor  and the company sounds like my dream company  so i applied  my friend stuck his neck out to recommend me  i interviewed  and i got the job  i m taking care of the paperwork this week  and i start on monday  that s the good part   now  the bad part  i m openly transgender  i live in texas  and my new job is in texas  too  recently  our lieutenant governor has promised to ram an anti transgender bathroom bill through the state legislature  and the lt  gov  has extremely strong powers over the state legislature  so he absolutely can do this if he wants  and the next session will be in the first half of next year  if that bill passes  i m gone  i ll put in my notice at my job  break my lease  pack my things  and move to a blue state  probably to socal  but that s still up in the air   basically  am i doing the right thing accepting this job if i know there s a very good possibility i ll have to quit in less than a year  it s my dream job  and i really   really   really  don t want to have to leave  but i cannot live in any state with a transphobic bathroom law  but it feels almost dishonest to accept a permanent position knowing that i ll probably have to leave it so soon  i will  however  do my job to the absolute best of my ability and act as if i intend to stay at this company for life  because there s a chance the bathroom bill  won t  pass  and i definitely intend to stay at this company for as long as humanly possible if it doesn t   i m also worried about hurting my friend  since he stuck his neck out to get me this job  this is a guy who s told me that i m like a sister to him  and the feeling is mutual  that is  he s like a brother to me  i m fairly sure he s not trans  i m not sure how much my friend is aware of my intentions to move  either  i mentioned it to him last month  not in the context of a job hunt  just venting to a friend about possibly being forced to evacuate my hometown  around the time he suggested i apply at his company  but he just kind of blew it off with  that bill will never pass  and i don t think he put two and two together  of course  he s when i told him that  he also said that he s confident bernie sanders will become president and nullify the law  so i know that his expectations of political events are unrealistic  i love him like a brother  i just think his head is in the clouds sometimes  and i made a post on facebook last month soliciting ideas for places to move to  which i don t think he even noticed  i can t tell if he s aware i might have to bail under a year in and simply accepts it  or if he just hasn t realized it yet and will be hurt when he finds out  honestly  part of the reason i made a throwaway instead of using my main is because he s a redditor  my main is linked to my real life identity  and i don t want him reading this post and knowing i was the one who made it   what do all of you think
boss was replaced by a micromanager  i need out,gender identity,__cscq_throwaway,2,3,0,neutral,5,1509599036,so   i posted last june https www reddit com r cscareerquestions comments oeozr starting a new job when i know i might have to  about how i got a job offer and i was agonizing over whether or not to take it because if the texas bathroom bill passes  i am openly transgender  i d have to flee the state   well  i took the offer  and the bathroom bill didn t pass  i ve been hear for a year and a quarter now  and the job was great  my boss was the best boss i d ever had  he was a mentor and a friend to me  note the  was  my boss quit at the beginning of september  his boss immediately rammed through an old friend and college roommate of his to replace him  and the new guy has been utterly horrible  all he s done since joining is pointless micromanagement  i m sick of it  and i need out   i m going to be updating my resume tonight   i need to know the best tactics i can use to avoid working at a place that prescribes micromanagement  i ve already decided i don t want to ever again work for a company that uses jira in any capacity  i m not going to work for any place where words like  sprint  and  burndown  are part of the vocabulary  how do i articulate this while looking for a job   it s sad because i like a lot of other things about my current employer  they re a conservative b b telecom with a suburban office filled with rows of cubicles  despite their conservatism  they wrote the single best transgender policy i ve ever seen in response to my hiring  this is  for the most part  a company i like  i m going to be looking for a very similar company  maybe not specifically a telecom  but i definitely insist on a company that s not a startup  that isn t a small business  looking for   employees minimum  that has a cube farm in a suburban office park instead of something urban or open  and actively shuns brogrammer culture in favor of a more traditional conservative image  and that s in addition to making sure i find a team that doesn t practice micromanagement or use micromanagement tools like jira and agile concepts   to complicate things more  i m going to move  the bathroom bill didn t pass this time  but they re going to try again in   and by then joe straus will be gone  i intend to apply for jobs in the la oc  preferably oc  and vegas areas  also  i can t fly for a variety of reasons  so i m not sure how i can make interviews work when i live out of state  are there companies who will hire on phone skype interviews alone  or will i have to use up all my vacation time to take a road trip across the country for a single interview   basically  what i m asking is what are good tactics to use in order to find a company i d like to work for  and how do i effectively hunt for a job in another state   thank you
looking for a non binary friendly workplace,gender identity,My8000thAccount,10,9,-2,negative,17,1511732047,hi i m an early career generalist  lt  years post grad  and i am also non binary  i did not consider my gender greatly when looking for a job and just looked for general signs that i would be ok being out at work and have found the reality to be lacking  the company i work fo pays a lot of lip service to inclusivity but they don t actually do a ton in the workplace to support their employees and i ve found that i m really uncomfortable with how my gender is perceived here  i m planning to try and move once i find a new job  been at my current position for almost a year  and need some help finding companies to apply to     tl dr do you know of companies that are especially supportive of non binary employees   edit  more detail from a reply thread   most people i work with are not familiar with the concept of non binary gender so they don t use my preferred pronouns  they them  and those that are ok with using pronouns then use me as their sole educational resource so i am constantly fielding questions   what i am looking for is a company where i will not be the first nb employee  there are already some procedures in place to help trans employees  such as hr professionals that are trained to deal with lgbt issues and can help address inappropriate coworkers    right now  i am having to spend an enormous amount of energy on my gender at work and i d much rather focus on working
job offer rescinded after i mentioned i was transgender  i need help determining if this sounds like discrimination,gender identity,ComprehensiveRope424,61,19,-4,negative,76,1528990030,for context  this job was at a software company headquartered in sf  however the office i would be working at was a small satellite office in washington state    i m aware legal advice would be a better place to post this  however i would really like the opinions of people in the field i am in  and if you guys have experienced anything like this  i posted this in the transgender subreddit about   weeks ago  but i wanted to get the opinion of this subreddit as to whether i should actually consider this discrimination or not  and what  if any  action i should take  i m not angry anymore about it  but if it does sound like discrimination  i want to do something to warn other lgbt people like me about this company    i m a transgender woman  meaning i was born male but transitioned to female  i m rather far along in my transition to the point where you would have no clue i was born male by looking at me or talking to me  so i m positive they didn t know i was trans by meeting me  my name and gender have also been legally changed  although this was only done about   months ago  these have never been my real names  but for simplicity sake  i m going to say my previous male name was  shawn  and my current legal name is  sarah   i ll start with the onsite interview  everything up to this point was rather standard  i had a phone screen  talked with the hiring manager over the phone  and then they invited me for a final interview  while going in for my interview i was a bit taken aback by the lack of diversity in the office  i mean i know the tech field isn t exactly known for having a lot of women or minorities  but i saw absolutely no diversity in that office  i ll admit the office was rather small at only   people  but i would at least think i would see at least one woman or person of color there  nope  of the   or so people i saw in the main area  there wasn t a single woman or person of color  every person who interviewed me as well was a white guy   the interview however  went really well     two days go by and i get a phone call from a recruiter  internal i m pretty sure  and the only woman i talked to throughout the entire hiring process  telling me they absolutely loved my background  and that the team loved me  and that they were really excited about me  she said pending references and background check  they were going to extend a job offer  she told me to send her my references  and i did  although i m not sure why  she was already calling the references on my resume while i was typing up the email about my references  my last two jobs knew me as sarah  however three jobs ago everyone knew me as shawn except the general manager  whom i told before i left i was transgender  and if someone called asking for sarah  then that was me  well i found out the day before my general manager didn t work there anymore  so i mentioned to the recruiter that they could call that place if needed  but that i was known by a different first name  so refer to me as shawn  she didn t say anything about it in the response email  and just said she would call my references within the next couple days  again by that point she had already called my references  well a couple business days go by  and i got a call saying that they had found another candidate that interviewed at the last second and they decided to go with him instead  she just kept going on on how great he was and how he matched all of my qualifications  seriously  she went on for like   minutes about how he was a better candidate than me  and how the team went back and forth between us  and why he fits the business s needs better  she said the team still really liked me and wanted to keep in touch in case another position opens  but she hinted it was rather unlikely   so now this is where i need help determining if this sounds like discrimination or if they really did find a better candidate at the last second  i mean  if they did find a better candidate  good for them  but do you really need to tell me why he is so much better than me  i mean in my mind that is just really unprofessional and suspicious  it just seemed like she was trying to cover the company s ass by overselling it    anyways  does this sound like discrimination  or is this pretty standard in the software world  have any of you guys experienced anything like this  this would have been my first software job btw   tldr  got a call from a company saying they were going to extend an offer pending reference and background check  told them i used to go by a previous name while sending over references  couple days later the offer was rescinded

women who ve been pregnant  when did you tell your boss pm  and why,general experience,VividLotus,11,6,-3,negative,14,1444694492,title pretty much says it all  i m interested in hearing from women who work in technical roles  especially at software or hardware companies  and who live in the u s  i d also of course be interested in hearing from men who ve taken or plan to take a substantial amount of paternity leave due to being the primary caretaker for a child  or some other reason    this is a question that comes up a ton in women s and pregnancy specific subreddits forums  but i feel like women in actual technical roles at tech companies are in kind of a unique position  most of us probably work primarily or even exclusively with men  so it s not like we ve got people around us taking leave left and right  even if your company offers paternity leave too  a boss is likely going to have a different attitude or concern about a man asking for a week or two off than a woman asking for an actual maternity leave  but at the same time  a large percentage of us can probably work right up until the time of delivery  and so we re not in the situation of women in male dominated blue collar industries or even other stem jobs that involve things like dangerous chemicals or physical labor

are women in tech supposed to wear makeup to work interviews,general experience,sorrythrowawaytaken,31,30,-4,negative,57,1508084338,ladies who are engineers  do you wear makeup to work  and do you wear makeup to interviews  even if you don t normally wear any  is it expected for women in engineering to wear makeup    everyone else  do you notice or have an opinion about female engineers wearing makeup    also  does it matter if a female engineer wears makeup  will others think that a woman without makeup is less professional or less competent as an engineer    i m asking this because  despite tech being known to have an overall more relaxed dress code than other industries  i noticed that most of the women in technical roles  and other roles  working in my office have some amount of makeup on  additionally  some female cs friends from school would put on a full face of makeup for interviews  even if they usually didn t wear any or usually only wore minimal makeup    i also noticed that a lot of women wear slightly more  professional  looking clothes than the guys  and when the guys go in the office with some free t shirt they got in college  no explanation is necessary  but if one of the girls comes in with less makeup than usual or with a relaxed outfit  she apologizes for not looking put together  and explains how she was in a hurry in the morning  etc  it s all self commentary  and i haven t seen or heard any instances of other people ever commenting on anyone else s appearance  but even so  it s kind of concerning  confusing  i m not really sure   but it s just that there seems to be some kind of unspoken difference in how women are expected to look compared to all the other engineers  i know that gender based appearance expectations are a pretty well known issue at large  but i thought that with how casual tech supposedly is in regard to appearances  it wouldn t matter as much  but it seems like it does

advice from women devs on the everyday slights,treatment,SoleSurvivorVault111,314,93,-21,negative,388,1544838181,i am a fairly new  woman developer  but i keep running into the same problem with some male developers  i am pretty shy and very non confrontational so it always catches me off guard when i am confronted by it  to elucidate my point  i have listed a few of the interactions    it was the last day of the sprint  and my story required a trivial code change in a file that a  senior developer had written  he was out that day so i sent him an email saying i was making the change due to the deadline  the change was small  it passed unit tests  functional testing  and code review  there were no issues with the code    i was able to finish my story  and we had   sprint completion  the next day i was met with a long email with my boss cc d about how i should not have touched his code in the develop branch    i reserve a room sometimes for instance if i need to talk to tech support so as not to disturb my cube mates  a peer stops by when i return to my desk to ask if i am having secret meetings and getting information separate from the team  i am very deliberate about sharing information and helping my team    i work with an older dev who is unfamiliar with some of the tools with which we work  frequently  he calls me to his desk for help  which i am glad to do  however  in meetings in front of everyone when someone states a relevant point  he will turn to me and very loudly ask   you got that  right  you are following this right  in a condescending tone  however  privately he is always going to me for help with his code     these are just some of the more annoying interactions  but i have plenty more  does anyone have any suggestions or tips about dealing with the onslaught of little daily papercuts  i am finding this to be hardest part with my job

i don t understand how to deal with disrespectful behavior and harassment in the office,treatment,temp1231156,0,7,0,negative,7,1545207690,intro   so a little about myself  i have been working in the industry for a little longer than a year and a half now and have recently started my second job in programming so i m not new  but not that experienced  i like to think of myself as a hard worker and as an above average employee  in my first job i spent a lot of my free time studying  coding on the side  i have often performed better than significantly more experienced colleagues       years in the industry  in my first job i was really excited and was fully dedicated to it  for example looked forward to working overtime since it meant to me more opportunities to learn  now i know that no one cares and it s best to just put in your   to   and go home  but still when at the office i work efficiently and care about the quality of my work     what i ve tried   not just in it  but in general i ve always found issues with dealing with colleagues when they re disrespectful  lazy  lying  etc  and managers have always seemed to be pretty ineffective by either not being able to control their employees   my colleagues or simply not caring  being lazy  as such i started early on to not be concerned with the work of my colleagues as long as it does not interfere with my work  though often enough this doesn t change much since there s either a certain maliciousness to the nature of difficult to handle colleagues or they feel threatened by my performance and actively start to hinder my progress  to handle these type of issues i ve tried different approaches in the past  the first being simply to avoid conflict  do good work and hope that i can find other people with a similar mentality and move in to work with them rather than work in an environment i don t like  but this is rather ineffective as there s not that much choice to change the people i work with  my second approach was to be more aggressive and basically any issue i had with a colleague i would raise it early on with my manager and if that had no effect would escalate to the next higher ranking manager  which didn t change much  since after contacting the higher ranking manager  my manager would distrust me and even if at first they were on my side  now they wouldn t care or support my colleague regardless of who s right or who works better or if my colleague is incompetent  i don t really know how to handle these type of situations or whether once you start working with someone malicious you re just kinda stuck  i m experiencing the same issue again at my present workplace and just don t know what to do      problem   i started work a month ago and my colleague started about two months ago  he is performing adequately his duties  but i finish up the same tasks twice as fast and with the same or better quality  ask less questions  i am more knowledgeable even though he has   years of experience and i always arrive on time  while he s sometimes late up to   min and with messy hair  unshaven  though this is minor  but there are signs from his side of inappropriate competition  harassment  however it s more difficult to prove and i feel like if i brought it up with my manager it could be ignored or my manager would just side with my colleague since i d be bothering him   basically my colleague has expressed minor insults over chat  tried to trick me in thinking that the working hours of our duties are different then they actually are  i suspect that he has been telling lies about me behind my back  i suspect this since once i walked in on him talking in the kitchen with another colleague saying how i don t know how i m going to deal with him  and another when coming back to a meeting room how to a different colleague he was saying  i don t know what to do about the situation  and both times the conversation would just stop  he has said small insults such as comparing me to his girlfriend or similar and one time when i was taking a particularly hard test at work at exactly the time i was about to start taking the test he invited other colleagues to come loudly talk with him nearby  there are other signs  but effectively this is circumstantial and though there are other actions to add to the bigger picture  the nature of this type of harassment is more subtle and secretive so it s difficult to build a proper case  his motivation in this would be clear as i m performing a lot better than him or he simply takes pleasure in this type of activity    if i believed that he s a decent person i d just talk about this with him  but i m sure that he would just say how i have nothing to worry about and would just become more careful  or to raise this with my manager is more difficult since i don t have that much to show  i don t want to ignore this since later down the line he can ruin my reputation within the company or cause me to lose my job  promotion  etc   my best course of action right now is to talk with the colleagues i ve seen him interact with and see what they in general think about my colleague and talk with my manager about the matter but only express a suspicion  however i m not sure what it would achieve  no one is going to just tell me that my colleague has been insulting me and neither will my manager do much about it      general thoughts   i really just don t know how to handle any of this all i want to do is go to work  do my job  go home  but it seems like no matter what  i ll have to handle some incompetent lazy colleagues and will have no tools available to deal with them  either i just have to adopt a similar approach and start trash talking them behind their back and such or just accept it  the working environment just seems to be enabling people to act maliciously  if in the future i d get a job working from home or become a freelancer would i still have to deal with this  does this become less of an issue when working at a better company or for a higher paycheck
should i quit  i am underpaid  my contract has been broken multiple times by my employer and now they want to take wfh away,treatment,Only_Vermicelli,0,3,0,negative,3,1546504847,sorry if i get mad in this post because this is literally my job and i m freaked right out and hope people can be patient with me and see past the anger and caps  it s nothing at anyone here ofc  just the stuff that brought me to consider quitting in the first place  d    d       i live in a low col area and opportunities here are limited   i graduated in april this year and landed this position shortly after  resulting in me at present having   months of post grad experience ontop of a   year internship  i do not currently know if i could get a job again here if i am being honest    i should add my at rest blood pressure i had checked a few days ago when i went for a dental cleaning  idk why they check bp for a dental cleaning  and it was   a few months ago when i went to see my family doctor it was   i never had this issue     i cannot imagine how high my bp is when i get emails from clients swearing at me or screaming about things that should never break in a system breaking  i cannot go into detail but we re talking some basic fundamental core functionality  i don t disagree with the client either  it s unacceptable   i truly don t know  and right now i am getting  official experience  which is a blessing because while i can hack away at home for hours on end it s not apparently enough to get an employer to care i exist    for this job they have    denied me healthcare when they told me i would have healthcare  only fairly recently getting it to me after complaints were made  it was scheduled to be upon commencement of employment     never did a salary review that was baked into the contract     never updated my title of my job  which it should be read as junior software developer or the likes and was promised to me to happen  yes that is my actual job but my title is different  i am doing the react  java etc etc programming      now  and it is mentioned absolutely   in the contract  they want to take away my ability to wfh  and i have come in whenever requested such as meetings or when requested  even if the thing i was requested for never happens that day and i came in for literally no reason    this is a big point because    the office is loud and has distracting people come in open the door and go  hey guys  and startle me and completely break my focus     light literally pours into where i sit and the light can and does get into my eyes    i want privacy flat out i do not like the way things are there     i respectfully want nothing to do with anyone there because i am dealing with my own issues     i have ptsd i am looking to get treated right now i have ignored for years from my rape  and yes for the record i mean penatrative rape  twice in one  session  yeah  i m trying to deal with it  it s   years late but i need to deal with it now because flashbacks mid workday aren t cute     i am dealing with general anxiety as well     i am dealing with losing a   year ltr that i tbqh care about infinitely more than this job  i was going to get married in a year  now idk where things are at     and the drama associated with that ltr like not being invited to weddings  inner family shame  the dad avoiding me when i went over  me having to hide in a car when they visited their grandfather and me feeling like i probably got heat stroke  and so much more     my mother falling to pieces because her mother  my grandmother  went after her  because my mother s biological father passed away and she got not even the sentimental ring from him passing on and   acknowledgement   and just more  wfh i knew   months ago when i signed the freaking contract was  a  huge  huge  huge  huge  deal   in fact looking back these things in the contract were why i took the job in the first place    i like healthcare  but i sure as heck didn t get it until just recently   upon commencement of employment  does not equal many months in    i strongly prefer to wfh for the reasons mentioned above      but wait  there s more   i know i am a new grad  and so i got warning signs during the interview that i ignored  this company is on the smaller side and even in the interview huge warning signs were everywhere telling me  don t freaking do this   you will regret this   examples   i asked them some basic questions on architecture and even before i got into the code i knew there were some ghastly issues just there    the owner of the company was in my interview and tbqh seemed super aloof and like he was better than me and even as he grabbed me resume just crinkled the fuck out of the paper   dude literally asked me after checking over my resume if i could write code for   hours a day  a real coding job   say my nose is out of place or i am prideful but if i wasn t a new grad and i had options i would have just walked out right then and there  i did a real coding job for   years where i worked on a project dramatically more significant than this one    their initial offer to me was part time that i obviously declined and so respect for me is clearly low from the get go    their system has no documentation  at all  none  when i came in we had none  we didn t even have slack or skype or any way to communicate outside of outlook email    i spent days trying to figure out errors so far  days  the system is in a complete state of carnage and chaos and me and a person hired the same time as me are desperately trying to break up new functionality of the system into microservices and such because we don t want to frigging deal with the old code base that is so horrendously bad    they have tried to do shady things like literally get into other companies to write down all their features and that    they have   comprehension what they are doing right now should be done by a bigger development team than the number of digits on one hand      there s just so much more and there s no point in me going into it in more detail on my issues those ways  there s tons     my feelings   i am a new grad and scared i won t be able to find another job  not sure how i d build  experience officially  and land a new job  the city i live in is not filled to the brim with software opportunities  i m on the verge of nearly   years experience and can do db  frontend and backend pretty stupidly easily but i m worried about getting a job because  experience officially  comes from having a real job and not hacking away at home   i am really pissed off right now  the contract itself that i signed has been broken over and over and over again and now they plan to take wfh away   i am making the same salary i did when i was hired as an intern prior to my   years exp at the internship and now nearly   months here  i cannot and do not want to pay the gas to drive an hour there and an hour back  furthermore i live up north meaning the roads are extremely dangerous to boot and gas to heat the vehicle along with the hour long drive  may as well torch another few thousand off my take home that is already pretty bad        okay why is the office so bad     it s hard to focus on my job there rather than at home  there are a lot of distractions and a lot of stress and tbqh it s so much more productive for me to just walk to my desk at home and get shit done and read up on new tech if i need to     sunlight bathes where i sit and tbqh is intensely distracting  i want the blinds closed because the sun comes in on me and it s horrendous  i am bathed in sunlight and i do not like it  it strains my eyes and makes me feel uncomfortable and overheated  even with the blinds shut some still comes through     it s an hour long drive there  and an hour long drive back  meaning i lose   hours of my day  and the gas is expensive  way too expensive to add ontop of my already low takehome  tbqh pay me  k extra and i ll consider this  which is what i should be paid in the first place      i am addressing ptsd i got from me being raped years ago as i said above  that s a huge thing and i don t want to have flashbacks in the office  at all     i don t want to go into your office where people are loud and distracting and randomly opening the door and shouting  i don t want to go into your office where a guy literally will grab food off of your desk and shove it into their mouth  again  are we in jr  high     coworker i work with has said many homophobic  elitist and other awful things in general  none directed at me ofc because that wouldn t make sense  but just in general    something bad happens  that s gay  what  are we back in jr  high  one coworker for instance during a meeting flat out said people are idiots and it blew me away  lots of over extremely offensive stuff   listen  i don t care to be frank about people s opinions but i don t want to be constantly exposed to that negativity and bullshit  i just don t want to deal with it  i don t want to be in a negative environment that enjoys ridiculing people over stupid shit               so i guess facts are idk what to do  i m angry and sad at the same time

feeling a little out of touch with my career path,treatment,acrosstheuniverse20,1,3,0,negative,4,1560421859,i recently landed my first software dev internship at a very large  popular company  i thought it was a dream when i got it  but now that i m here  i feel like i may not be cut out for it  i am still an upcoming senior in undergrad so i shouldn t be comparing myself to my project managers or even fellow coworkers  who are full time employees  but  sometimes they ll be  very nicely  explaining concepts to me and i m just sitting there thinking that i will never be able to be so organically knowledgeable about software dev  i guess it s a mix of imposter syndrome  even though i studied for an entire month  day and night  for the internship s interviews  because i just don t feel nearly as competent to have an entire company or even my teammates relying on me for anything  i only just got into programming about a year ago so this is all very new but at the same time i feel like i bit off more than i can chew  i also sometimes convince myself that i only got this internship because i was a good looking young hispanic woman  not even so much for my talents  which only brings me down more    my dream in life is to be a software engineer for one of the top tech companies but i feel like i m barely even bright enough to have gotten this internship  how do you deal with having intrusive thoughts of unworthiness within your tech career  especially among your peers

is the company i work for toxic,treatment,ennuiDB,9,6,0,negative,15,1561344416,i recently started working in the engineering department of a small publishing company after a leaving a really horrible startup  at first i thought it was great because the people seemed really nice and they d offered me a promotion and more money than i d asked for  but it s been four months now and the cracks have started to show   the first obvious crack showed up during the first project i worked on  when i d interviewed they told me that they wanted me to work on a greenfield project but a lot of the work had already been started  albeit without a clear plan  by another engineer before i got there which was fine  what did bother me was how defensive that engineer would get whenever i asked him about the choices he d made when writing the application  his code was bad and he clearly didn t care  even though we have about the same yoe  he s about twice my age and i got the impression he resented me for being promoted when he hadn t  he eventually asked to be moved to a different project  weeks after i d suggested that he be removed to my manager  and i got to work with this other really talented guy who d joined two months after i had instead which seemed to solve that problem for the short term  however it s a pretty small department and the older engineer has had to be warned for acting in a confrontational manner towards me since then   the second major crack was with a dev ops engineer who i had to work with briefly on an infrastructure project  similar age to the other guy and he seemed a little grumpy at first but i could at least work with him  i got the impression that he liked me too as he would praise me in front of my colleagues and didn t seem to mind when i pointed out mistakes in his prs  one evening during work drinks  i d asked him to explain a position he d taken in what had been a friendly debate and just out of nowhere he starts cursing and yelling and name calling like he was possessed  and he did this in front of more junior members of staff and in front of my  manager  i tried to keep my cool but didn t back down in my line of questioning  my manager  being a typical liberal  appealed to this weird bothsidesism bs in order to  diffuse  the situation  i reported the dev ops guy to hr the next day who actually took his behaviour seriously enough to make him quit three weeks later  when i confronted my manager  who s about the same age as me  so mid s  about why he d done next to nothing  he insisted that though the dev ops guy had been completely in the wrong  he had called my manager worse names in the past so it hadn t occurred to him to do anything about it  my manager had said something a little similar about the bad engineer from the first project i d worked on  i e  because older members of staff regularly disrespected him and had done at previous jobs  he had learned to just tolerate them  the dev ops guy apparently had a history of yelling at women during meetings but because the women who complained weren t engineers  nothing really happened  it later came out that the dev ops guy had hit another member of staff whilst i was in the bathroom that night and presumably my manager had said nothing about that either   i ve spoken to a few people in senior management about this and i get the impression that there s a desire to improve the culture and the engineering department as a whole  however i feel like in middle management and at the ic level   as much as i like the guys i m working with right now   there just isn t the will to question the status quo at all  i ve seen it particularly in the way in which the infrastructure was maintained   that dev ops guy essentially was the platform team before he left and he constructed a set of aws environments with brittle puppet code that just made no sense and bore no resemblance to the infrastructure i d seen at previous companies  though to be fair  this is the first time i ve had to work all that closely with infrastructure code  he also left hardly any documentation and could be quite cryptic when i asked him technical questions  prior to the incident at the bar  whenever i asked my manager if it made sense to give staff aws training  he would insist that the dev ops guy could teach us everything we needed to know  now that he s gone  guess who s expected to help pick up the pieces   d  i guess i m just curious as i still don t think i know what a good work environment really looks like in tech  is this normal  does my worrying about this so much make me a pussy  does this seem like the sort of place where management will learn from their hiring mistakes or should i expect the worse  what does the fact that they tolerated those toxic engineers for two years say about their hiring me  if anything  would love to hear what you think

is the industry this bad for black women,treatment,Heimeimiao,256,194,-20,negative,439,1565899527,so i just finished an internship and frankly  it was the worse experience of my life  i would have rather worked in fast food and the only saving grace was the pay   i ll start by prefacing that i m a black woman and a senior in cs at a top school  and probably top   cs school  i m not sure of the rankings  although i m admittedly average at leetcode  i have a good portfolio and past  relevant  work experience   here s a highlight of everything that happened     from the beginning  i was offered very little guidance on our codebase  technology  etc  so getting everything set up was a disaster since i was on my own with understanding how everything worked  and oftentimes when i d message someone  i d get ignored or i d get a non answer  in person help only happened when i started constantly annoying multiple people with questions  it always seemed like no one really wanted to help me  though     the company is decently sized and based in sv  and they have  diversity initiatives  but they re laughably bad and i m almost certain now that i was the only black female developer in the entire company and one of maybe   underrepresented minority women  but it s not like there were too many other people outside of white men actually     it was immediately clear during meetings that they really didn t have a place for me on the team because they had to find stuff for me to do  but the other intern on my team never had this problem  most of my tasks were not programming heavy or required much thought  but they were large tasks that were very monotonous     the engineers on my team and other teams would talk poorly of one of their interns when i was there  they openly trashed his abilities and throughout the entire program  gave him simple tasks and justified it by saying that he couldn t program  he was an underrepresented minority and regardless of his skills  it was inappropriate to gossip about other interns when i was present     we had a majority black  male  department actually  and they re pretty vital to the devs  and the devs love to talk down to and openly insult them  perhaps it s a superiority complex thing  but it really rubbed me the wrong way  so i went out of my way to be extra nice to them  and they were super friendly     even after i told other devs what team i was on  i d still get asked my major  my team is the backbone of the company and requires the most cs knowledge  yet no other intern was asked their major  we had a luncheon so that s how i know  it felt like the devs had to confirm that i was actually a cs major even though everyone on my team was     the women devs were the nicest ones there and actually treated me like a human  most of the men were either super standoffish or ignored me when i spoke to them  there were a few men that were super nice and welcoming     if a person asked me a question  some devs would butt in and answer it when the question wasn t for them  this happened a lot     i had small   person meetings about something i d been working on and even if someone was speaking  they never looked at me or addressed me directly     questionable content in company group chats     some devs made backhanded comments about me not knowing different tools  like git  command line  etc     i was talked down to and infantilized by team members     they had a super high turnover rate  and it s from people quitting   i did eventually break and have a few crying sessions in the bathroom because i hated working there and if it wasn t for the pay  i would have quit a month before my last day  i know now i need to be more assertive and vocal but these were known problems that have been discussed in internal company forums  and it really makes me disillusioned with the entire industry because if i m going to be treated like crap regardless  why bother   edit  i just want to add that i m coming to this conclusion because the other intern  isn t  treated this way  besides the other black intern on a different team  the one on my team is treated exceptionally well and if i were treated like him  this would be a good internship experience  obviously there s company culture issues but not everyone is treated this badly  which is why this bothered me  if everyone was treated like shit  then it s whatever  but when you have people getting treated better than others  for no apparently obvious reason  that s a cause for concern  i did mention a number of times where the other interns weren t treated like i was   edit   i know git and the command line  i also use tmux and vim  i also addressed this point in a few comments in this thread

how do i make friends at work,treatment,deckthesocks,0,1,0,negative,1,1569454915,hi  i hope it is okay for me to post this question in here   i am a female who just turned   i started at my current company last year after graduating with a degree in ee  it is one of those companies where most people are either in their  s or   years old  the thing is  as ridiculous as it sounds  i see a lot of the younger people at my work hanging out together  grabbing lunch  socializing  etc  and tbh i wanna be a part of that too  i guess  fomo  is the right term for this even though i hate that word lol  i usually pass these groups in the hallway or lobby  or during lunch   but i feel like these groups are there because these people work in the same team  or at the very least work closely together  otoh  i am one of the youngest people in my team  we have an intern who is   years old  but since he s still in school  it s not like we can  hang out  much  and while i am pretty close to my teammates  most of them are over the age of   which isn t a problem ofc  but idk it s just that i do wanna try to hang out with some people around my age group as well  i hope i am making sense  i think i also feel sorta lonely after graduating because most of my friends moved away   my question is how do i insert myself into these groups  i think i also feel kinda apprehensive because a lot of these groups are majority male  expected given the field we are in  so i find it pretty intimidating
i feel like a diversity quota hire for my internship,treatment,klarrynet,59,38,-2,negative,95,1569792717,i m not sure if this is the right place to post this  but i haven t been able to get it off of my mind ever since i got my intern offer  if there are any minorities who ve gone through these feelings  i d love to hear how you dealt with them   a few weeks ago  a faang recruiter reached out to me for my resume  and then got me signed up for an on campus interview  i figured that they got my contact information from my applications from the past two years  and assumed that the reason they reached out first was because i was a woman  my suspicion was confirmed when i saw that   of the people at the day   interview were women   the whiteboard questions were fairly straightforward  and i m honestly really proud of how i did on the second day interview  you had to pass day   to get to day   i illustrated my thought process out very well  and my interviewer had to ask almost no leading questions for me to get to the optimal solution  that being said  i feel like the questions were almost a bit easy for a faang interview  not to mention that there were only two interviews total  i got asked about four questions   obviously  i m delighted that i got the offer  and i do think i m a very capable programmer who ll do fine there  still  i don t feel that i ve deserved it at all  knowing that this interview was literally set up as a diversity initiative  and that the interviews i had might have been slightly easier  and shorter  than what normal people might have had to go through   what s worse is my attitude about it with the people who found out  everybody has been really happy for me  both the men and women  saying i deserve it  but i keep shoving it off as  i did do well on the interview but honestly i wouldn t have any sort of offer if i weren t a girl which is really doing a disservice to all of the women engineers out there  this isn t the first time i ve pushed off something as  it s because i m a woman lol   namely my internship from last summer  but this time  i really can t be proud because i know that i got an interview soley because i m a woman   i guess i might be acting spoiled about the whole situation  and should just accept my lucky situation instead of complaining about  but did i deserve it  since at the end of the day  it doesn t change the situation much  still  if there s any advice anybody has as to how to process these feelings  i m all ears      edit  thanks for all of the supportive comments  i think a few contributing factors were probably that a week before  i had a couple of technical challenges that were much more difficult than what i was expecting  and i just barely passed one of them  got rejected right away by the other  because of that  i assumed  ah  all big tech companies must give interview questions that are this hard  not realizing that sometimes  you end up a bit lucky without an intentional  we re giving this job to you because you re a minority       in addition  and this is probably the biggest factor that i didn t realize at all  a lot of the cs kids at my college do this very annoying thing where they judge your worth as a person with wherever you re interning  a lot of them assume every person who gets hired at a big n is either a genius or had connections  and that nothing could possibly be wrong with your life if you have a good sf internship  i hate having expectations on me  and i don t want people to have an inflated impression of me because of a lucky opportunity i happened to get  this is a reaction a friend of mine already had  i ve begun to realize that i should just ignore all of that bullshit  and enjoy myself without worrying about what these people think
early career  yoe  advice   promotion vs leaving,treatment,shrazzzy,0,1,0,negative,1,1570855706,hi everyone     i ve lurked on this subreddit a while  but only now do i have a situation that s left me at a crossroads      about me  i m at   yoe as a software engineer at a large  but not tech  company  i d been working very diligently towards a promotion to the software engineer   level  now that it s time for this promotion to finally happen  or atleast i thought  i just found out that for the last   months since a re org  no one in our subgroup of   people has been getting any promotions due to a logistical issue  management is aware of the issue but not much is being done about it     the work itself is fairly decent  i work in technologies that are somewhat on par with industry standard but to be honest you can imagine my experiences as a   year old female in a team of   male developers over the age of   basically  i end up getting assigned a lot of grunt work get left out of certain decision making processes      i know i need to leave  i think  but i m struggling with my exit strategy  i live in a major city in california  not in the silicon valley      at this experience level  i could either sit around at my current role for another year and apply for senior level positions afterward  but if i did that i d be pretty unmotivated this year since there s not really much room for upward movement learning new technologies  there s a chance management will do something about the logistical issue with promotions and i could be moved up in the meantime too      or i could get out of my current role now at the same level  or at the software   level  hopefully be more motivated learn more at another job  the idea of studying for interviews again is frankly a little terrifying seeing how competitive things have gotten in the three years it s been since i last applied     there could definitely be other options i m failing to see as well     thanks for reading

how to navigate office politics w  regards to being an  ally,treatment,throwawaygirl27374,58,23,-1,negative,80,1571437455,throwaway here for obvious reasons   most of my coworkers use reddit   i m   and a female engineer in a male dominated org  i ve been working   years out of undergrad  so not really a whole lot of years in the industry    my director is a woman but i don t know how much perceived legitimacy she actually has  everyone likes her because she s friendly and nice but everyone also knows she has zero say in the technical decisions  and is more the  people side of things  than anything technical  she leads the  women in engineering  group for our org    the problem i m running into is that she expects me to be a more active proponent of her diversity efforts  i m one of the more senior women in the org  the rest are mostly entry level  and she wants me to be more visible and active about being a woman and helping other women and posting in the org diversity groups and overall be more of an advocate for women    however  if i m being completely honest  the main reason i don t want to do this is because    this takes time and focus away from me doing actual technical work that would get me promoted    i get the overwhelming sense that people who mention diversity get taken a lot less seriously in the workplace afterwards  at the very least  technically    and so i m not sure what to do from this position  i don t believe i am obligated to do what she wants me to do just because i m a woman too  but on the other hand she sits in on my promotion reviews and i think it really does bother her that i am not as active as she thinks i should be    this might be the wrong subreddit to post it in  but wanted to get an opinion for what the best thing politically to do here is  thanks
