(i say normal in quotes because while obviously nothing is wrong with wearing a head-covering, it's just less expected than usual.)   i liken a situation like this to asking for vacation or special treatment early in the interview process. sure, sometimes you need to say things like, ""one month after my start date, i have a two-week family vacation i need to go on"" or ""i need to leave early every monday to take my kid to soccer"", but you don't usually mention them on the first interview. you usually wait until you've accepted the offer, because you don't want anything to get in the way of them loving you and offering you the position. in the end, you wearing a head-covering at work will be no issue (at any reasonable company), but you don't want anything stopping you from getting in the door.",positive

crrqtfe,381e1k,t3_381e1k,treatment,208,"hi op, sorry to hear about your troubles.  i'm a guy, so keep that in mind.   problem is, people assume you have no idea what you're doing, until you prove them wrong. (i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let matt handle this.)  i joined my current company last year and i feel the same way about my workplace. everyone else has a few more years experience at this company and a lot more overall years of experience. i haven't had this issue in any other job before. so what i'm suggesting is that you have gotten a bad group of people like myself and it may not be a gender thing, although that is how it might feel. (i don't know either way, just suggesting that there are alternative issues maybe).   and then even after that, if i happen to do something faster/cleaner than someone, the reply i often get is something along the lines of 'wow you did it faster. i must have really fucked up.'  this to me at least sounds like an issue of the new person making the old person look bad. in any case this is a really shitty thing to do. you could take something like this to heart and get upset about it, or you could joke around with them and not let it bother you. this will do a couple things, it will show them you won't let their comments bother you, it will also show them that you are their to work and threaten their positions in the company(depending on how they take it). you don't have to be a jerk or mean or anything, just throw light jabs that will bruise them or embarrass them.    there have been several cases where they were wrong, and i said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because i should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.  depending on when and how you correct them it could piss them off easily. if you are in a meeting with everyone on your team and you point out even the obvious mistake, this would embarrass that person easily. the trick is to point out the mistake, not lay blame though. this may be easier said then done. your wording is key as well, don't go hey sam you made a mistake here and i corrected it. it should be softer like, i was fixing this problem and i found something that i thought could be written like this and changed it. or something to that affect. its not a mistake you corrected, its a better way of doing it.   so the question is, how do i get past that people who don't know me immediately assume i don't know what i'm doing, and how do i be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?  i completely believe you when you say you are feeling gender related issues, i saw it in school, i see it in my current workplace. however i think the issues you describe are parts a) level of experience and b) ass-hole co-workers.  if you arn't asserting yourself as an expert when you speak, your body language etc. then people will see the opportunity to walk over you.   just speak with confidence, have research to back you up if you think its needed, do your work as good as you can.  be ready to take the hits sometimes and when you see the opportunity be ready to give them out. again, you don't need to be malicious about it.  lastly,   for clarity, 'matt' joined around the same time (a month later than i did), but there was more confidence in him and other guys who started around the same time  does matt have more real world experience then you? is his education university while yours is college? is matt bonding better with his co workers then you? does his job naturally involve more complicated and complex work then yours?  there are a billion reasons why matt might be treated better then you or anyone else on your group. you need to think about what the differences are between you two. gender is one, probably small issue of that.   i got treated very poorly at my old job because everyone else on the floor had bachelor degrees (or higher) and i had a college degree and pretty fresh at that. i turned that around through my attitude and work. you can close some gaps in the workplace, its a matter of identifying each persons issue with you and addressing it.   hope any of that helps you.",positive

(i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let matt handle this.)  it takes a while for people to trust you - you have to prove yourself constantly, not just once, for a while, to get ""automatic respect"" in this sense. as for matt having it, it could that he has a better background  (more years of experience before you, worked at a larger company, etc) so some people might put more weight on that, like having an ex-googler or fb engineer on the staff vs. a bunch of recent graduates with no much experience - even if they started at the same time in the company, a manager will put more trust on whoever has more experience. with that, that can level out, if you perform well.   'wow you did it faster. i must have really fucked up.'  that could be interpreted in two ways (depends on the tone of voice and the person) so i can't judge it - it could be a condescending comment (like ""i must have really fucked up if even you were able to do it faster"") or it could be a self-deprecating comment (""you were able to do this much faster than i could - i must've really missed something very obvious"").   there's another experienced (female) se who's really good at what she does, and i've noticed that people are condescending towards her sometimes too.. (mocking her for little things)  again depends on tone - se is a boy's club, for better or for worse, and this little mocking and condescension is common even among males, specially if there's a friendly atmosphere. in a way, the more you're mocked (if playfully) the more you're belonging to the group. you know how men will mock and curse at each other but it's all play? this could be it, but more subtle.    problem is, there's always some indignation and resentment if i happen to do something faster or correct someone. there have been several cases where they were wrong, and i said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because i should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.  then it's their fault they can't handle their ego getting hurt - just keep doing your thing and doing it well and you'll be respected in time, even if they don't show it in a way you might expect.   so the question is, how do i get past that people who don't know me immediately assume i don't know what i'm doing  you don't - people will tend to assume you don't know what you're doing by default, unless you are a very very nerd-looking asian with a ti-84 in your shirt's pocket, or you come with some pre-selection (like another trusted engineer in the team vouching for you and saying you're great). it's just how humans are wired and process stereotypes - we're still not used to seeing woman in cs, let alone women that are *great* at it. just give it time and keep giving your best and you'll prove yourself over time. cs is a meritocracy, so you have to earn your merit, it is not given to you by default for no particular reason... so just keep doing what you're doing.  a great way to break the ""taboo"" too is to get a big project (like the one they gave ""matt"") where people doubt you can make it - then you go and make it brilliantly. you won't be doubted a second time, and if you are, you can refer to the *big project* that you did as reference, then there won't be a third time.   and how do i be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?  that's a tricky one. it is not a gender thing and it is - men will get pissed when their egos get hurt because another guy did something amazingly better than them... and it can hurt extra if they are outperformed by a woman (just like it would extra suck for a man to lose at arm wrestling to a girl). you can't control other people's emotions, but you can keep doing your thing and eventually they will adapt and get used to it and quit getting pissed. it's not your fault they're getting pissed, it's their own problem (due to their ego) so there isn't much that you can do.  what i would do in your shoes is try to show them you're not out to get them or [explicitly] compete with them - for example, tell one of your coworkers that you would like their opinion on something. show them a problem you have and the solution you came up with and ask their opinion, if they think it will perform well, if they can think of a way for it to perform better, etc. this will tell them you are not out to compete, but that you're not helpless either because you're not asking for *help*, you already solved the problem, you're just asking their *opinion* - this puts both of you on level ground, as equals, and also shows them that you value their opinion and that you are looking to collaborate, not compete... then thank them for their input and that's it. just make sure your solution is actually really good (so he won't scratch the whole thing out and come up with something much better) or it can backfire (make you out to be incompetent).",positive

crs8hss,381e1k,t1_crs046q,treatment,208,"so firstly, let me say that i'm also a woman. at the same time, i agree with people who've questioned whether the things op is observing are really gender-related. why? because there are a whole lot of other reasons as to why coworkers might be condescending to someone, and certainly tons of other reasons why someone might say ""let's let someone else do x task"".   with regard to the former thing: it's often very hard to notice whether someone is behaving a certain way only toward you/only toward a select number of people until you blatantly talk to others about it. for example, i was once in a situation where i had to interact frequently with a high-up executive for a while. this person's emails and verbal interactions were incredibly terse, and i was terrified i'd upset them and was going to be fired. i assumed it was just me. but after randomly bringing this up in a group of others, i discovered this was how that exec acted to everyone.   with regard to the latter, unless op has some really solid logic for why she should have gotten x task instead of ""matt"", i don't see any reason to assume that's gender-related. maybe ""matt"" spent his entire previous job or his entire master's research on some topic highly related to the task at hand. maybe the pm has op in mind for an upcoming task that she's well-suited for and ""matt"" is not, and that's why ""matt"" gets that task. without more details, it's hard to say.  the bottom line: i'm sure sexism does happen in tech, but i don't think it's healthy or productive to leap to the conclusion that because you're a woman and because something negative or displeasing happens at work, it must be because of your gender. if the thing that happened was someone saying ""well we need matt to do this task because this is really important, and male programmers create fewer bugs than women"" then sure, go ahead and assume. but otherwise, i don't see a reason to.",negative

d29g1d0,4fievg,t3_4fievg,general experience,114,"throwaway b/c i'm gonna include somer personal info and stories. black devs are so rare that i think someone would probably recognize my story if they cared to. call me paranoid; i don't want it pointing directly to my main account.   * black male * no cs degree, self-taught career changer   i'm currently working as a front-end dev on the west coast. i've been a developer for just under 5 years. before i got into programming i worked as a worker drone in a big large corporation in a very large ""traditional"" type of industry.   most of the issues you may have will be a result of being an educated black person and working around individuals that are not used to diversity.    since i graduated high school and went to college (liberal arts degree, ha!) i've been in a majority white/asian environment. i've been asked (with decreasing frequency over the years) if i was ""really black"", or ""all-the-way black"", or if i had an asian parent (my eyes slightly resembly stereotypical asian eyes). the frequency of these comments have decreased because i think as people get older they get better at hiding their true feelings; i tell my kids all the time that adults are great liars and that children and old people are the only honest people in our society.   i'm currently working in a very small team of under 10 developers. i think my manager made racial/cultural diversity a point, because none of us share the same background. east asian, south asian, white, black, foreign, and higher female representation than average. i really like it here because i've been given huge responsibility and my opinions are taken seriously even though i don't have that much experience in the industry.   before i tell you about my previous job let me go back to the point i made about being an educated black person in a non-diverse environment. especially nowadays people are really touchy to bring up the race issue. they'll consciously censor themselves, and while they may think they're being sly, i've been black my whole life and i've learned the tell-tale signs that someone is censoring themselves heavily.   when i was younger i spent a great deal of mental energy trying to fight against the black stereotype. you know exactly which one i'm talking about. that we're a bunch of welfare recipients and criminals. i've had girlfriends and roommates tell me ""i'm glad you don't talk like a black person,"" or ""i was raised to think black people were bad, but you're cool"".  when i was younger and less mature i didn't know how to handle these blatant backhanded compliments, but nowadays i just take it in stride. i'm not going to let someone take up mental space in my head with their dumb commentary.   you may face some choices early on whether to be the ""cool black person"" or the ""wow, are you really black?"" person. i'm the kind of person that when i first meet you i'll speak perfect english (so that you don't think i'm ""one of them""), but after i'm certain that you don't think i'm ""one of them"" i'll let my guard down and start to talk ""black"". (btw, why do we get shit for ""talking black"", but other races or nationalities don't get shit for speaking in a foreign language?). imo i would follow my path, and speak the queen's english at first. once your coworkers see you as ""one of them"" you're done. you'll never recover.   the whole ""talking black"" thing bit me in the butt at my last job. i let my guard down a little too early and paid the price later on. i eventually got fired from that job, not because i was black, but i'm certain that me letting my guard down had something to do with it.   here's the story: you know when you first meet someone and you're very formal and stiff because you don't know the person well? well, after i let my guard down i could literally see my (white) manager's reaction go from very formal to ""hey brotha, what's goin' down?"" i really didn't like that, and i didn't like him because he was a micromanaging know-nothing that thought he was a genius. this guy was a dick, and we didn't share a sense of humor, so long story short when it came time to make a decision on my future i am certain that because he saw me as ""one of them"" the decision was easy.   as a educated black working professional you'll second-guess yourself frequently. you don't want to be that person that blames everything on racism, but what if it was. how can you tell? you'll learn over time, that's the only advice i can give you in that regard.   i would recommend trying to find a mentor that shares your background. when i got my first job out of college (not a programmer) i had some older black ladies looking out for me and trying to show me the ropes. because i was young and inexperienced i didn't really understand the gravity of what they were trying to do for me. they warned me about some people and gave me advice. listen to your mentor's advice.    this has been long and rambling, and i don't really care to proofread or edit b/c i have to get back to work now. if you need clarification or extra details comment below and i'll be happy to reply.",positive

d29sedb,4fievg,t3_4fievg,general experience,114,"black male game programmer here. 6 years developing generally, 1+ in the game industry.   i am a black female nearing the end of my high school education and i am taking interest in becoming a software engineer or a computer hardware engineer.   do it! we need more women in stem fields. you folks invented programming, damn it. take it back!   i'm wondering how often i will meet people of my same gender or race in the cs workplace.   it depends on what counts. i've met black people, male and female, at every job i've had. managers? game designers? artists? qa testers? sure, there are a few. i have met a black *software engineer* exactly **once**, not counting the handful (4) that were in my graduating class.    if you are a black or female developer, can you please share your experience?  the only black guy on the team, every job. by team, i mean the 5-15 people i interact with on a daily basis. occasionally i might meet/talk to other black people, but that's typically outside the scope of work, and typically the other guy is not a programmer.    are women and minorities treated differently?  i honestly couldn't say. i don't think so, but given that a lot of the problems we face manifest themselves outside the context of where they'd be obvious, i'd say there's a good chance i've had some issue ultimately (unknowingly) caused by race.    how often do you see these kinds of people?  not sure what you're asking. the people that treat us differently?  i mean, the biggest hurdle we face is the institutional/societal one that comes into play long before we start submitting job applications. it's when *literally* *all* the black people you see doing well in life are either athletes or entertainers. and popular/critically-acclaimed black films are almost always about slavery. it's a god damned shame, and it's also the reason why so few women/minorities end up in this field.   growing up, when i decided that i wanted to work in the game industry, i did so because i was too stupid to notice that no other black people were doing it. if i'm being honest, i probably also noticed that everyone who wasn't japanese was also ""breaking into"" the industry.   edit: you know what? i just remembered that at my last job, someone on my team second-guessed literally everything i did for several months, until it became painfully obvious that i was competent, and he stopped. i was never around him enough to notice if he treated anyone else that way. to this day, i don't know if that was a racial thing, or what. but it wasn't like i screwed up something easy early on; i was just always treated like that by him.   are startups or big companies more likely to have women and minorities?  i couldn't tell you. pretty much no matter where you work, you'll see a ton of white dudes. maybe a few hispanics. you'll probably be the only black person. the other women, if any, will be white.   though, from what i understand, the large companies (facebook, google, etc.) tend to have a ton of foreign developers on work visas, so that's a thing. i don't know it firsthand, though.   i've been hearing a lot of terrible stories of how black people can be treated poorly and it is very difficult to keep myself from switching what career i want to be.  what i've personally noticed is that white people, unless they're actually racist, tend to try hard not to say/do racist things. they don't wanna be ""that guy."" occasionally, you'll end up working with ""that guy,"" and it sucks. but mostly, it's fine, and people are cool.  you just have to be okay with being the only black person in the room. and okay with not causing too much friction when ""that guy"" says some sideways shit, then looks directly at the local ambassador of the black federation. it helps that race is a federally protected class in the us, so it's job-affecting-level shit if someone screws up along those lines.",positive

d29mj55,4fievg,t1_d29gk6m,general experience,114,"asian here, the idea behind micro aggressions is really stupid. a lot of the time what is labelled as one is usually due to someone not knowing something. the worst thing you can do is get mad and cry about micro aggressions when you can take the time and explain why what they said might be ignorant or a little offensive. or you can suck it up and just be polite.   the 'where are you from' question itself usually isn't a problem. it's the follow up of 'no where are you really from'  which can be very irritating because of how it is asked and what it implies. the better way to ask this question if you want to know what kind of asian a person is is to ask their ethnicity and not assume they are automatically an immigrant becuase i will always answer that question with 'canada'   the worst thing anyone can do is cry 'microagressionssss' and then say 'it's not my job to educate you'  when the person didn't know any better",negative

[it's a cnet article, but it's what we've got.](https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/) it puts the ratio of women in tech roles at 15.6% for the big 5, lower then the graduating rate. and i think that that ratio is even worse is smaller shops. i only work in startups, and those had 0%, 0%, and 8%. i honestly think it's the other way around.  something that i noticed interviewing, though, is that women usually seem more prepared, and matched to the job posting. there's research that shows that this is related to self-worth: the theory is that a man with 3 years of experience would apply to a job that requires 5 years of experience, while a woman in the same situation might not. if she doesn't, it seems that women get hired more per ratio. but that is because where a man might fail an interview, a woman might not have made it to the interview in the first place. so, even when men and women would be equal in ratio and abilities, more men would show up, and more would get rejected. it's not all attributable to that, and difficult to prove, but i do think that does make a whole lot of sense. all the women i've worked with were incredibly competent and driven. and maybe because they have to be.",negative

dfjvt3o,622ddy,t3_622ddy,pregnancy,35,"like others have said, feel no obligation to tell them beforehand and just show up. but i'd like to offer a different viewpoint:  an internship is more than just an opportunity to gain work experience. while your employer is evaluating you, you should be evaluating them!  any place that does not treat you as an equal due to your gender is not a place you want a full time job at.   as for telling people at work: treat it just like you would with potential friends. my coworkers share when they are engaged, expecting babies, going on vacations, etc. workplaces are much more enjoyable when you build connections and friendships with your coworkers. don't feel you need to hide your pregnancy. if you're excited about it and want to share / discuss, go ahead.  personal side note: the whole idea of having to fit a pregnancy into your lunch hours is garbage. i realize this is more an issue with living and working in america. but i would strongly encourage you to hunt down organizations that are offering fair paternity and maternity  leave packages. the only way to really drive change is to reward companies (with your employment) that have hr policies in line with the majority of first world nations rather than the current backwards archaic policies that are often the norm in usa.",positive

dn9dr3s,71ars5,t3_71ars5,general experience,32,"hmm. i have realised that while job hunting this is something i want to be looking out for as well. possibly i have always been subconsciously doing this.  my first job was at a pharmaceutical company that liked to employ ex medical staff, mostly nurses, so they had a large number of female employees. mostly these worked in admin roles though. my team had 2 tech employees, one male, one female. two small a number for it to really matter. it department was mostly male, but head was female. generally i'd say that despite that company being majority female, the very senior staff were mostly male.  second job had an even mix of men and women across a large team. from varying backgrounds though and it was the least technical job i've done even though at a big tech company. plenty of women in tech management positions.  current company is a small software company with pretty even male/female mix. 2 female devs, 3 male. support team are very technical and an even mix there. directors also have an even split. i have no idea how intentional this is, but there is definitely an even level of respect and gender doesn't even play into anything. in other places i've seen men be given the more interesting or more difficult work and i've not seen that at all where i am now. it's a very small company though so easier to keep that in check. also no competition - we are working together as a team to achieve something, rather than individually trying to scramble up a hierarchy. no question is stupid, it is understood and respected that we have varying knowledge and we try to share that knowledge.",negative

dnbgli7,71ars5,t3_71ars5,general experience,32,"i've been thinking about this question and i hope i have some thoughts that will help. in my experience, when you are faced with something that is clearly logical and yet discriminatory, you should look at what you actually want. first, let's get the discussion of whether this is discriminatory out of the way. basing decisions on gender is discriminatory, but discrimination is not always illegal or even immoral. so, talking about discrimination isn't very valuable. i made that mistake in my other comments and was down voted to oblivion (which is an awesome way to spur conversation.. why ask a question you don't want answered?)  i, personally, don't like working for companies that are run by the sales department. that's discrimination, but a kind that few people would find offensive. but, i never actually make that a deciding factor. i consider things like work environment, amount of planning, flex time, compensation, etc. these things tend to rule out sales-based companies.  what is it you actually want? there's no problem wanting to be around people like you, but that can't be all of it. when trying to attract female candidates, i never directly appealed to women. i emphasized things like flex time, greater good, time for education, better planning, collaboration, etc. these are things that tend to attract more female candidates, even if they are not universally important to women.  one problem with looking for a company with more women is you're getting a snapshot in time. they may hire exclusively men for the next five years, leaving you in a bad place. if you look for the attributes that tend to attract you and other women, you'll end up in a place that is more likely to have a greater concentration of women in the work place.  also, look at the management. if the company has no women at the executive level, then any attempt to hire women will be artificial. they may have more women in engineering, but it won't necessarily be a good place to work.  so, what i'm trying to say is that you should look for a company that has a culture that appeals to you. maybe more importantly, you should look for a company that appeals to women. if you do this, it'll make hiring and retaining women easier. you'll get what you want without being explicitly discriminatory.  also, remember that you'll be hiring people within 6 months. you can go to meet ups and convince good female candidates to apply. your company will love you for it, maybe pay you a finders fee. but, if you join a company that sucks for women to work for but happens to have a large number of women at this moment, you'll end up in a brogrammers world.",negative

doeikq8,76hu3n,t1_doefice,general experience,57,"what?  sexism in the workplace is just as pervasive today as it was 20 years ago.  bias is often something that goes unrecognized because it's learned behavior, not something that people actively engage in.  i don't think that anyone wakes up in the morning and thinks, *ok, let's go put some women in their place today*.  sure, overt sexism exists, but typically it's more subtle than what you'd see on mad men; i have personally experienced my ideas being rejected out of hand, or referred to a male counterpart for concurrence before being accepted.  at my last job i was lead developer on a project - designed the entire thing from front to back - and was still forced to run all my ideas by one of the male developers before implementing them even though i was more senior than they, and they never faced the same requirement to get concurrence on the projects they ran.     promotion to leadership positions is another area where women face additional scrutiny; i worked on a team where four of 10 of our senior developers were women, and even though all of us were  comparable in skill, and experience only the 6 men were encouraged by the management team to apply for tech lead / principal developer positions.  sometimes we weren't even told that the positions were open; we had to go look for them, and apply ourselves whereas the managers often informed the men that they'd be submitted for the position by the manager themselves.  in one case one of my women co-workers beat out a male co-worker, and then management decided to hire a consultant instead to prevent any hard feelings about sally beating jack out for the role - literally that was the reason - yet many times men had been promoted over women in the organization, and there was never any concern for hard feelings over it.    this is life for women in it.",negative

dofh6ha,76hu3n,t1_dof1epn,general experience,57,"people wouldn't have to worry about being perceived as sexist if they'd take the time to exercise some empathy. actively attempting to see life from another's point of view can really help build empathy.  the first rule of programming is to know what the problem is that we're trying to solve before we code, but for some reason men in it have trouble applying that rule to dealing with sexism.  are you trying to avoid being *seen* as sexist, or are you trying to not actually be sexist?  see, if it's the former then i understand why many men feel like they're walking on eggshells; trying to navigate sexism without actually knowing what it is, or how to avoid engaging in it would certainly feel stressful.    think about this here; there's a gap between the number of men vs women in it; that gap is greater the higher up the chain you go.  women hold about 25% of all it positions, and only 11% of leadership positions. there are mentorship, and training programs just for women because we are forced to navigate a system that was not built for us, nor buy us; it's not suited to our needs, but it is what it is.  with such a lopsided representation in tech, these mentorships, and support programs are necessary to get more women into the industry.  as for productivity; level promotions aren't just about who does the most work, or the best work; they're also about who can do the best job at the next level. the likelihood is that the women you've seen promoted were actually best suited for the new role according to the current management.  as more women rise the ranks the priorities of the system will change. for example; maybe you'll see free pads and tampons in the office right along with the free coffee.  actual comfortable, private breastfeeding / pumping areas instead of a bathroom stall.",negative

drlwqtz,7kwwim,t1_drkiumc,treatment,612,"what you did in your post is called gaslighting.  i'm aware of what gaslighting is, and that's definitely not what that comment was. my comments on the situation were in no way minimizing, manipulating, discrediting, denying, or made in any attempt to gain power. it was simply a case of recognizing a situation that i've seen play out many times and giving my thoughts. if you think those thoughts are wrong, that's fine.   when used to deflect claims of sexism, it is itself sexist.  ok, so it's sexist to say that something might not be sexist. this might hold some water if the original comment actually was gaslighting.  i guess you're not going to address your implication that defensiveness is a female characteristic. at this point, please don't bother.   i get that you think you're being helpful here, just contributing to a conversation, but the way in which you're doing so is an extremely common form of negative reinforcement against anyone who reports discriminatory behavior.  if only i had you to follow me around all the time to let me know how what i *think* i'm doing is different from what i'm *actually* doing. no negative reinforcement here, and in fact i included ""maybe that's not it at all"" so that op would feel welcome to let me know if, and in what way, i was wrong. she didn't engage, and that's totally fine. it's reddit, it's really not a big deal.   your thoughts here are not unique nor insightful, nor are they helpful.  thanks op, sorry i didn't have anything more helpful to share! wait a minute...   your intention doesn't matter.  your opinion has been made clear long before now, haha.   was the person telling you this trying to convince you that you hadn't experienced something you definitely experienced?  yes, once very recently, actually. it was something that i *thought* i'd experienced, but i happened to have misinterpreted the situation because i didn't know what i didn't know. i learned something. it was a good day.   this is, once again, a really common tactic by people attempting to defend indefensible behavior. suggesting that the problem is with the person reading their defense, and not with the defense itself.  this is taken without context. this ""indefensible behavior"" you're referring to is someone providing their input on something that i've experienced, particularly in the case where their interpretation is different from mine, or they know something that i might not. i certainly *hope* that people will continue to do that to me, since every now and then i pick up something new from it (or maybe just learn something about that person, good, bad, or otherwise). suffice it to say it definitely doesn't bother me. if it bothers you, that's ok, we're all different.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯    no, there's no disagreeing, here... your experience is neither useful nor insightful, which is what makes relaying it shitty.  again, you've established your opinion. since you're not the person i was responding to, i'm sure why your opinion is relevant... or why i'm wasting my time writing all of this.   not every person has a useful or valuable viewpoint in every situation.  agreed! it's seems likely that op had either already considered mine in this situation, or disagreed that it was the case. that's completely fine. it didn't hurt anyone for me to write it out.   feeling the need to regurgitate ... is *in fact* a trait commonly exhibited by men...  what was that you were saying about citations?  once again, i wrote it knowing that if op thought it was inapplicable she could just move on past it. that seems to be the case.   if they're not useful, they're not useful. your comments were not useful. ...doesn't make it useful. ...doesn't make it useful. it's not useful.  you seem super passionate about this, but i'm still not sure what your opinion has to do with what anecdotes op may find useful, not useful, entertaining, boring, or otherwise applicable.   defending your post on the idea that you were just ""sharing an opinion"" doesn't make it useful.   i never said i was sharing an ""opinion,"" just something that i've experienced.   defending your post by trying to claim some kind of reverse-sexism oppression doesn't make it useful.  never said that either.   next time, don't share it. it's not that hard.  you really do seem pumped up about this! you know that this is an internet forum and you're not obligated to read my comments, right?   we're raised to believe that we need to have opinions on everything, and it's always ok to share them, but we don't and it's not.  that's an interesting projection. i've never been told, or felt, that i need to have an opinion on everything. can you imagine how much time i would spend on reddit if i had to have and express an opinion on everything? lol  if you don't like reading about other people's experiences and opinions (or at least feel as though someone should be policing them), reddit might not be the place for you. you do you, that just seems like it would be really stressful.  the person i initially responded to didn't reply, and that's completely fine, but as such i'm gonna be done here. internet arguments never changed anyone's mind or behavior, and it's my opinion that we're wasting our time here. if you want the last word, you can have it, though i won't be coming back here to read it. no offense meant, we just both have better things to do.",negative

dt0otce,7rwcit,t1_dt0mwnj,treatment,178,"i'm looking at [eeoc](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm) guidelines, specifically this: 'harassment can include ...and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.'  and i'm looking at two things. one, it seems to be continued harassment. she directly told her coworker twice that she wanted to keep her drawings private, and he's clearly ignored her discomfort. other people have noticed it, and he's told other coworkers about the drawings. two, it's of a sexual nature. my guess is that a lot of her discomfort is directly caused by the fact that the drawings are sexual. i think she would have been less uncomfortable if they were just really embarrassing non-sexual drawings.  there really doesn't need to be sexual assault involved, or unwanted touching to be harassment. people can be sexually harassed at work without those things. for instance, repeatedly harassing someone about their personal, non-work related dating/sex life can be sexual harassment. it's not a requirement that the harassment be related to flirting or hitting on someone.  edit: i saw elsewhere that she doesn't think it's sexual harassment. i'm definitely not telling her that she should. and there's also a huge range in sexual harassment. but my point is that this seems serious. and other people might see some red flags in this story and think this deals with the companies internal sexual harassment policy. for instance [this manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7et84f/does_this_count_as_sexual_harassment_do_i_have_to/) is worried about how he responded to rumors of harassment that just involved conversations about an allaged affair. i'd guess that the companies internal harassment training and policies explicitly deal with similar situations. a free consult with a local lawyer might be useful just to have a conversation about how other people, like management and hr, might view this. even if she has no interest in suing, i'm guessing she'd be happy with a verbal conversation if it got the harassment to stop and her drawings weren't brought up again.",negative

dueinny,7y81at,t1_dueg0ae,general experience,331,"right! as the other person mentioned, that’s the goal.  think of it this way. minorities are underrepresented, right? and that underrepresentation feeds into itself — people who grow up without seeing similar people in stem fields or movies or whatever are themselves less likely to pursue careers in those areas.  proactive recruitment techniques are an effort to overcome this underrepresentation. but the thing is that it would be wrong (on multiple levels) to hire somebody purely because of their race or gender. how do we increase representation in a field without just hiring people because of these factors?  the answer is recruitment. let’s take the example of a career fair. if a company only focuses their efforts on that one career fair, their candidate pool will have the same demographic makeup as the career fair — it only makes sense. but who goes to career fairs? well... traditionally, career fairs are held at universities, and the attendees will be the students, and if the students are predominantly white males then that is the kind of person the company will hire. not because they’re deliberately seeking out white males, but because they’re just using the same old channels which are filled with the results of underrepresentation.  so instead what companies do is they perform recruitment aimed at diversification. they hold events specifically for minorities, and they filter initial resumes to find minorities. does this give the minority applicants an advantage in the recruitment process? yes, of course. but nobody — **nobody** — is *hired* because of their minority status. once your resume is selected and you make it to the first interview, your race and sex are (legally) not in consideration. if you don’t qualify for the job, then you don’t get the job. the difference is all in which resumes are filtered, essentially.  now, this isn’t to say that some companies don’t do the wrong thing. if a company is too “lazy”, they might choose to deliberately hire somebody because of their race or gender. this is illegal, but hard to prove. but this also is overwhelmingly not what happens.  essentially, we have a sort of “affirmative action” thing going on. and it’s important to realize that these programs are designed to over-compensate for a history of underrepresentation. companies need to be proactive in recruiting minorities until we get to a point when their internal demographics align with the real world. after that... i’m not sure. we may still need some specialized recruiting for a while, but i cannot predict the future so i’m not sure what’ll happen on that front.",negative

dugjd7h,7y81at,t1_dug4sys,general experience,331,"from a managerial perspective, i kinda have to disagree at the idea of the practice being ridiculous. in fact, i think it's necessary (and i don't mean that in some sort of social justice way; purely business). and as for folks keeping it secret? i mean... considering not hiring someone based on gender/race is illegal, i would be more shocked if managers/interviewers did run their mouths openly and regularly about doing this. at least, they wouldn't be managers/interviewers for long if they. that sort of conversation is better kept to the anonymous webbernets, ya know?  at the end of the day, i think it's a completely logical solution to a proposed problem, from a business perspective. think of it this way: when someone gets hired on, they are hired on for their value to a company. for most workers, productivity is the value. for some, however, the value extends beyond that.  right now, there is a big push in the industry for ""equal representation"" in the workplace. it's one of those buzz word/phrases that picked up and has become a force of nature all on its own for company image (like ""open office""). this particular requirement, the idea of trying to hire an equivalent number of women and men / white folks and poc, is a particularly challenging task for corporations. if you took, in raw numbers, all the men and women in tech (not just people current working, but also those looking for work or being trained in school), the men would likely outnumber women on such a scale as to be downright shocking. for instance: 10 years ago, cs classes in smaller universities could have 40-60 students, and only 2 would be women. i'm sure those numbers are a little better now, but i doubt by that much. i don't know why this is, whether social issue or some failing on the part of the schools; that's something for people smarter than me to figure out.  what i would care about, as an interviewer, would be hiring people that achieved value for me/the company. much like companies in silicon valley spend hundreds of millions of dollars on their campuses to look modern and stylish, diversity is worth investing in as well. both help your image greatly, and image sells. many people want to buy tech from the most progressive company, and that makes ""equal representation"" valuable. so if marketing came up to me and told me that achieving equal representation could bring in millions or even tens of millions in extra revenue for my company? my interviewing tactics will start to get very flexible.  behavior interviews aren't just the ""easy"" questions to fill interviews with; they tell us, at the core of it, whether you're an asshole or not. you can sum it all up to that, if you want to get super simple about it. if i'm trying to achieve equal representation on a team of all white dudes, and a young black lady comes in and applies for the position, i'm probably going to interview her a little differently than the dudes applying. behavioral- is she an asshole? if no, then maybe i skip the tech portion depending on her resume and go straight to hiring. if yes, then maybe i'll tech interview her to see if she's at least a talented asshole, which puts her back in the running.  this is something that i wish more women readily accepted, rather than taking offense to, because that young woman may not remotely realize how much power over the negotiation she has. this isn't just her wanting the position; the interviewer probably will want her in the position even more! she could command a pretty solid salary from that negotiating standpoint, even if she was walking in with a junior level knowledge base.   now, is any of this fair to the employees? is it fair to the men, who can be beat out by someone less knowledgable / experienced? is it fair to the women, who have to deal with the possible stigma of ""was my interview easier than theirs""? of course not, on both accounts, but that's totally irrelevant. people negotiating different pays and benefits are also unfair. that's business, and business usually isn't fair.   the reality is that, in silicon valley, you are worth more than me as an employee. hands down, i don't really need to know your skill level to make that assertion. hiring me will hurt their diversity numbers, which is directly attached to their corporate image; and for most of those companies, image sells. hiring you will help those numbers, and that's direct $$$$ value. if you also happen to be talented and good at what you do, that makes you very valuable. and if you're not? meh, $4,000-$10,000 in training to fill your knowledge gaps is a steal to the company for the other intrinsic values you would bring.   affirmative action has value to a company. much like many people tend to see apple's new campus as a ""waste"" of money, many people see aa in the same light. they are wrong on both accounts. image is everything in tech right now, and any investment into that category is one well made.",negative
duge1mk,7y81at,t1_dueojjp,general experience,331,"diversity is a difficult issue and it's hard to paint the whole picture by just looking at one set of stats. like you mentioned, it's too simplistic to stop at ""asians are overrepresented in tech"", since much of this is driven by the lack of geographic diversity in tech. a company based in chicago, for example, is likely to have a much different ethnic breakdown. geographic diversity is useful for other reasons as well, for example, it seems silly that people are expected to relocate to silicon valley if they want to have a bright career in tech. this in turn creates barriers for other kinds of people from non-traditional backgrounds, for example, those who have people to take care of and can't easily relocate, or people who have established their lives but want a career change, or many other people.  another nuance is also in the link i provided above which shows the ethnic breakdown of people in leadership roles. asians are far less represented here.  and there's even more layers to this - asians are typically immigrants, or children of immigrants. this is a self-selecting group of people who were either determined enough or rich enough to immigrate from asia. black people, on the other hand, arrived in america in far more depressing circumstances and have had generations of racist laws and policies against them. (not to say that [asians haven't had any racist laws against them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act)). part of the ethnic makeup of tech is a reflection of society and not specific to tech. this makes it difficult to determine how much of a role tech ought to have in going against what isn't directly their ""fault"".",negative

dvhrynp,839y69,t3_839y69,general experience,178,"i've been working in tech for 7 years and overall things have been good, but i've found that i've experienced some bias as i've gotten more senior(around years 5-7). for context, i've been at the same company for most of that time and have gotten promoted twice. i've faced some issues on my current team and i see the straight out of college female developers say ""gender issues don't effect me!"" and i remember a few years ago when i thought that as well.   i'm not saying this to dissuade you from pursuing tech, i don't regret doing so and love it! there's just some things i would've liked to know earlier as i thought that tech was a meritocracy.   as i've been working to get promoted to senior software engineer and taking on more leadership roles on larger teams, i've found some resistance. it mostly comes in subtler incidents like people ignoring my ideas and later restating them, new teammates overly challenging my technical ability (over male colleagues), managers making biased statements about other women(""is this female senior engineer technical enough to evaluate this?""), teammates constantly asking me to take notes for meetings (despite me being one of the most experienced people on the team), some managers trying to push me into management roles because of my ""soft skills"", etc.  i've also found that i sometimes fall into traps that women often fall into: thinking that our performance will speak for itself and not pressuring/pushing management enough on career development.  my main advice to women as they move up past more junior roles is: * for meetings you run, take good notes and send them out after meetings * if management is giving you vague feedback ""you're doing a great job!"" lookup strategies to solicit more specific feedback. [here's](https://hbr.org/2015/05/how-to-get-the-feedback-you-need) and example article * document your accomplishments regularly and tie them back to business accomplishment and goals. this can help you (and your manager) make a case for promotion * networking with people outside of your team but still in your organization can be beneficial both for finding new opportunities for yourself, opportunities for cross team collaboration, and to build allies for your career development  on my more recent promotion, i think getting vague feedback and my management creating a vaguer case for promotion delayed me by more than 6 months. there are studies (at tech companies) that women often get vaguer feedback - both critical and positive. this can hold women back on promotions because they don't get the feedback they need to improve and it's harder to decide to promote someone if the case is vague. [here's](https://hbr.org/2016/04/research-vague-feedback-is-holding-women-back) an article from harvard business review. when i was denied initially because of ""coding"", nobody could give me any specific thing to improve on and i was told ""you're doing great! keep doing what you're doing!"".  i'd be down to give more details of specific things in a pm, but don't want to write out my specific details here.",positive

dvw2hzv,85a0mk,t3_85a0mk,pregnancy,130,yes and maybe for my company. i would say that being a woman makes it easier to get your foot in the door for an interview compared to other new grads. the final say for hiring always comes down to skills though.   as for the pregnancy question i will admit that it has come up when discussing a candidate privately even if it is illegal. new grads go through 3-5 months of a lighter workload and training before being placed on a team. if someone leaves for a month or two within a year of being hired they tend to have to repeat the process to catch back up. we have also had 2 hires in the last year who decided not to come back after having their child. if we really like you and are confident in your skills you will still get hired. if we are on the fence pregnancy may hold us back from giving you a chance.,positive
dvw7735,85a0mk,t3_85a0mk,pregnancy,130,"i think it probably depends on what region of the world you live in.   i am in north america. i do believe being female improves my visibility in the job market-it doesn't get me jobs, but i do suspect i get a few more opportunities then others at times.    i also think in my region that being pregnant (and verbally confirming you are) would likely be a negative to bring up during an interview. regardless of if you chose to take leave, or not, its kind of a hot topic where i live--women who both do and do not take leave for their kids can be portrayed negatively. take leave-you're a risk, are you gong to come back, etc? don't take leave-judged for not being there for your kids, etc? i would just avoid the topic all together. i'd just keep it professional. internally in my company (past hiring), pregnancies are celebrated, but we are also large enough to support parents who want to take very long leave.    i would suggest you think about having a child in your senior year, not because of the child/pregnancy aspect, but that you may want to consider getting some experience and steady footing in the industry before you (potentially?) take leave. pregnancies can be very complex and you may be out for a while, so think about if you want that gap potentially right after your graduation. a long gap after grad for any reason will probably be questioned, and you'll have to make sure you are keeping up your skills. you know whats best for your family ,though.",positive

dvwhyyb,85a0mk,t3_85a0mk,pregnancy,130,"i went to a big us university after coming here for computer science. i can give you some good information. it's somewhat ""anecdotal"" but at some point you have to consider it as more than anecdotal because there was over 1,200 students in cs at my uni.  i was also in my school's ""minorities in engineering"" student organization. it was one big org but sort of ""internally"" split into sections, not officially split but we did it just so we can organize special events for each one like black history month, etc. i was most active in the hispanic and latino part.   i have to say, women truly seemed to have the most favorable odds. most women in cs when i attended had internships every summer while many of us guys would resort to taking classes because of either a lack of internship offers or even a lack of getting interviews at all. personally one that stands out to me was when i had a direct line of communication with someone at microsoft and suddenly i stopped getting replies after a week of organizing an interview, meanwhile a girl (a good friend i still speak to) had a flight out to their hq after a phone interview, who had actually just applied the night before she got the flight. they called her the next day, gave her the phone interview, and called her back that night and invited her out.  as someone active in my organization we'd often have some companies give talks or meet with the organization (the whole school too, but they'd always have dedicated time for us specifically as the people who invited them out) and they would definitely focus on the women. race didn't matter either, they tended to still go for white or indian women over black or hispanic men.   i heard similar things from friends about many tech companies or companies that hire a lot of tech people, google, facebook, apple, intel, citi, vmware, twitter. the only one i heard that didn't play this preferential treatment game was amazon and i assume that's because of how they drill into their new hires anyway that they just take anyone, but i don't actually know, maybe just nobody applied to them.  keep in mind, this is entirely on the university/graduate side of things, not already-in-the-game engineers. this was all for internships and eventually new grad hiring. the game changes when you're going for senior engineers and i've been lucky enough to avoid it by moving up my current company due to my own hard work instead of hopping around.",negative

does he even know what the fuck that whiny dev was on about, or was he just parroting him? why the fuck was he sending you a long email instead of sitting down with you and optionally, optimally, the other dev and talking through what happened? deep breath we are having empathy here. ugggggggggggh. regardless of whether or not the root of this happening was a *process issue* there is a very clear *personal issue* in that a lengthy email from a party that was only tangentially involved is a batshit stupid way to handle a new dev making an apparent mistake. in my very professional personal opinion, that personal shit is way too much to even begin to unpack. it's something you can chalk up, for now, to ""it's a new workplace and interpersonal shit is awkward."" but remember it. keep a note of it. so that if it happens again, or continues to happen, you have a good record and examples to fall back on. you can say, ""hey guys remember when x, y, z"" and solve the problem from there. but anyway.  right now i would approach it as purely a process issue. you want your approach to be, ""this is a problem, this is a thing that happened and could happen again where a dev being out was preventing me from completing my work and i had to make changes to his (**?????????????????**) code in order to to my job. clearly just making the changes was not ok, because manager said so, so what do i do *moving forward*? tell me what the process is, and if there isn't one, let's work together to come up with one\~!""  moving forward is one of those fucking business terms that makes me die inside every time i say it buuuut it's helpful to get you and the people around you out of anything you want to leave behind. and this approach is nice because of so many things. you aren't making yourself out to be a victim which, while you absolutely have been a victim of shit management, is never an identity you want to claim in the workplace or really ever. you are showing that you are competent and that your decision wasn't made with malice or even particularly with ignorance. and you are showing leadership in taking responsibility for both making that choice and in taking responsibility for learning what to do in the future. you're putting yourself in a position of real power here and i dare anyone to try and take offense to that. and if they somehow manage to find a way to take offense you have a \~\*\~\*\~\*\~severely toxic workplace\~\*\~\*\~\*\~ and i have no advice for you except get out get out get out.  for the guy who is up your butt about secret meetings... ughh... okokok what a poor scared little bean. maybe he's been burned in the past by secret meetings which turned out to be about firing him forever. maybe he's just naturally afraid. maybe he's doing too much of the cocaine and blacking out all his windows just wasn't prevention enough, they're all out to get his cocaine, all of them, all of it, trust no one, ever. i don't know, i'm not a psychic. but like... this guy. i would brush this off and idk maybe try to just get to know him better. that's a good way to deal with people who are scared of you. make them less scared using the power of \~\*friendship\*\~ and \~\*kindness\*\~. yeah it sounds terrible but actually it's nice. you get a friend and you also get to stop hearing stupid fucking questions about secret fucking meetings or what the fuck ever.  how to make a friend with someone: 1) ask them questions 2) about their lives (kids, partners, hobbies, weekend plans, evening plans, what they did last weekend, where did they put the cocaine, stuff like that) 3) make eye contact and seem interested and ask follow up questions until it's polite to end the conversation 4) remember at least one of the things and bring it up later 5) repeat steps 1-4 until they stop fucking asking you inane shit and you find the cocaine  same with the old dude. he probably thinks you're there to replace him. \~\*\~\*\~\*\~he might be right.\~\*\~\*\~\*\~ but that's not your problem, that's between him and management. ask him about his hobbies. yes everything he has to say will probably be borderline unbearable. my favorite is people who ask you if you know a movie or a show or a game, you answer by saying ""no"", and then they proceed to tell you all about the fucking movie or show or game anyway and they aren't good at explaining it and you actually have work to get to and you're sitting there and they're still talking and none of it makes sense and do they realize you're bored because you're trying hard not to look bored but you're so fucking bored.... ffffffff... but anyway yeah, the guy is scared of you. a good way to handle it if direct confrontation seems exhausting or like it won't go well is to just make friends so he becomes less scared. soft skills! it's a lot of work but the payoff is very worth it.  anyway sorry for the ramble. i wish you the best in your endeavors and i hope all your coworkers actually just get chicken pox and leave work forever and you don't actually have to deal with them at all.",positive

ebtfp1i,a6708a,t3_a6708a,treatment,385,"admission: an male.  after my own experiences with toxic work environment, here are my answers.  start looking for a new job. if they ask why you’re looking for a new job so soon you can play it off or out them for being toxic; your best bet is to play it off with the new employer, i think (that’s what i did). my excuse was it was too far away from home, the commute was too long. which it was, so it wasn’t necessarily a lie. i didn’t want to say my boss’ boss was a jackass who didn’t know what he was talking about even though i had all the emails to back it up. (you don’t store wsdl in a column in an oracle table to make a dynamic soap web service that reconfigures itself on startup).   until then, anyone who calls you out should get called out back in kind.  for number one, it’s tough to give examples without more specifics. if you’re using git the you should have made a feature branch and a merge request to put your changes back into the dev branch; that’s just good git practice. but if that’s not your team’s practice, then never mind; that’s the only good excuse for complaining about something like that. otherwise, it’s tough to explain how to respond to them without more context, except to say you should ask questions like “where is that process documented? or did you just expect me to read your mind?” “if that’s your code, why weren’t you here when it needed altered? if that’s your job why did they give it to me?”   for the guy talking shit on you in meetings, something like “yeah, i’ll explain it to you you after the meeting like usual” or something. he’s probably trying to make it seem like all the time you spend tutoring him is actually him tutoring you, in front of the team who probably sees you in his cube all the time but isn’t actually aware of why you’re there.  to bring this comment full circle, you’re obviously in a toxic environment. sexism doesn’t technically change the outcomes and responses for you. step 1, start working on getting out of dodge. step 2, take no shit. step 2a, give all shit in the measure it is given; if they say shit at a team meeting, respond immediately in the team meeting, and always replay all to any email.  honest people who make a mistake will acknowledge their mistake, apologize, make amends, etc.  toxic people are toxic. toxic people, by their very nature, cannot admit fault or accept responsibility. if you try to call them out, or correct them, or anything except take it from them, they will only become more toxic.   this is why my suggestion numero uno, and all your most upvoted replies, are to gtfo.  everything else is about mitigating the toxicity of the toxic people until you can gtfo, or by some miracle neutralize their toxic.   to neutralize the toxicity, your best bet is to make sure everyone who saw the original comments is exposed to your antidote.   and yes, toxic people hate being stood up to. truly toxic people will always try to escalate, to enforce their toxin on your meager, pathetic, unworthy self. that’s just part of the definition of a toxic person; it’s as predictable as the rotation of the earth.  so if you mouth off, they’ll try to make things worse.  that’s why i recommended making sure everything is as public as possible. reply immediately during a meeting, reply all in an email message.  let everyone have a chance to make their own judgements based on all the facts. we aren’t all a bunch of assholes!  i mean, i’m an asshole. denying that much would make my closest coworkers and friends laugh hard. but i’ll go to bat any day of the week ending in “y” for a junior dev, intern, teammate trying their best and showing the least bit of promise.  i won’t say don’t be a dick, because passive-aggressive snark is prime ammo.   but i will suggest that you don’t get cocky and try to stuff it down their throat. always leave yourself an out to admit a mistake. although, that’s passive-aggressive 101 if you really want to break it down.  unless you’re 100% convinced it’s literally impossible, like in my case where my senior architect wanted us to store the wsdl in the db table so every time it booted up it could reconfigure the web server to handle the redefined protocol, literally dynamic soap web services, don’t burn that bridge. just let everyone know that bridge is a mine field, and respond how they see fit.  good luck!",positive

ebveyuu,a6708a,t3_a6708a,treatment,385,"late on the train but also female dev here. probably similar advice to others.  1. that's just plain rude and incredibly arrogant. not to mention, as a senior developer, this is a terrible thing to do as you should be allowing junior devs to learn by letting them try things out. on this point alone, he's actually not doing his job.  assuming your boss is reasonable and not an ass, then i would reply back to the email, boss still cc'd.  the main point of the email is to politely ask for constructive feedback. e.g. here's all the protocol i followed and was given the go ahead. is it protocol i didn't follow or is it the way i changed the code? if latter, give me constructive feedback.  essentially the point is, since he wants to be an ass by cc'ing your boss on that email, throw it right back at his face and basically point out all the reason why you didn't do anything wrong and get him to explain why you've done something wrong under the guise of getting constructive feedback. if your boss isn't stupid, he should be able to tell who's in the wrong here. i would even add a small quip in there to say you think it's great to be able to learn from people more experienced than you so please give you the feedback needed. basically, rub it into his face all the things he's not doing right as a senior dev.  2. i don't even.....understand what this is  3. if you want to embarrass this guy in front of everyone, then next time he's doing this, ask ""yes, i'm following. are you?"" or ""yes, why? you want to ask for help later again?""  however, probably the wisest choice is talk to this guy one-on-one and ask him why he thinks he needs to do this in front of everyone and that it's condescending and it's making you comfortable and go from there. if one on one asking him to stop doesn't work, i will then escalate to a superior or hr (if your company has one).  my main advice is, find a company that doesn't have a toxic culture. your company sounds toxic. are there anyone you can escalate to who you know would support you? if it's a hard no, then consider finding a better workplace.  i have been fortunate enough to work at a place that supports women. so much so that within the company, i don't really have to deal with this bs.   i experience most of my sexist experience at client side and having a good company culture means having colleagues who back you up. for example, clients always assume i'm non technical and requires repeating that i'm their technical contact multiple times to get it. in certain cases, my male colleagues would step in and insist that client talk to me. that's where it's helpful when the entire team rallies together to support you.   in more serious cases, i'm able to escalate to my boss and he/she will have a stern word with their counterparts to make sure whoever is misbehaving gets put in their place. i have once escalated to exec levels even and our execs were more than happy to go to their counterparts and ask them to keep their employees in check.   otherwise, for day to day quips you may get, i usually call it out in a non-confrontational way e.g. cracking a joke that calls out on their behaviour. the best one i heard from someone is, ""you shouldn't say that. it shows your age.""   if it's rude enough, then it's straight up shut it down and saying that you find that comment inappropriate and you would appreciate it if they don't say it again.  and if that's still not enough, i escalate.  however, escalation only works if your workplace will actually support you. if not, back to main point. find a better workplace.  just stand firm, call out bad behaviour and also, you need to fight fr opportunities. man are more often to fight for opportunities while women are more self critical and think they're not ready for the challenge. so another advice is, put yourself out there more and take challenges more to keep honing your skills.",positive

ee27sh6,afy2ae,t3_afy2ae,general experience,335,"female swe here. i graduated may 2017 so my job search was semi-recent; i feel like it's generally easier to get an interview/recruiter attention, but the actual interview is pretty much the same as what guys get. now as someone on the other side interviewing candidates, i've never been told to give easier questions to minorities for the sake of diversity either. (i'm sure this depends on company.)   the rest of your questions really depend on what kind of company and team you join. i currently work at a big 4 company on a product team and to be honest, i don't really think being a woman has affected my day-to-day career much at all in the sense of others not taking me seriously. i think i've been lucky in this regard, & it's definitely due to some other factors such as my company being pretty inclusive, my immediate team/managers being very supportive & actively aware of and managing potential bias, and the fact that product work touches upon a lot of different departments than just engineering (design, legal, business, data analytics, etc) so it doesn't really feel like i'm working with majority men. at a previous company i interned for, i definitely felt the gender divide a little bit more; there was an occasion that a senior level engineer didn't believe i was an intern & thought i was someone's girlfriend or daughter visiting the campus.   however i do know that it affects my internal thought process which manifests in behaviors that probably aren't good for my career. women on average have higher levels of imposter syndrome and generally aren't as aggressive/vocal in the workplace, which may hold us back b/c we're ultimately supposed to be the biggest advocates of our own work. i've spoken with my managers about this in the past and they've noticed a distinct difference in tone with how their female reports and their male reports speak about their work, with the male reports being much more confident. not falling into this imposter syndrome/self-doubting mentality is probably one of the best things that you can do for your career (easier said than done, unfortunately).   this post is getting pretty long, but please let me know if there's anything i could help bring more clarity to. feel free to pm me as well!",negative

ee34cbd,afy2ae,t3_afy2ae,general experience,335,"i graduated about three years ago, and got a return offer from an internship to a big n company. i work in their toronto office, though my internship was at their headquarters on he west coast of the us. locale differences are probably a factor here as i definitely noticed more stress/competitive/toxic attitudes in the us office.  as a caveat, i'm a dyke and dress like it, so i might have a different experience than more feminine women. i also came to the office already engaged, so it was fast to come out as 1) gay if you didn't already know by my outfit and haircut, and 2) off the market. possibly as a result of those factors, i've never had unwelcome come-ons.    what you'll experience depends heavily on your team. i highly suggest you look for mentors who you can talk to about your experiences and any issues that come up who can 1) validate you so you don't feel crazy, 2) give you advice both technically and interpersonally, 3) tell you to gtfo when you're still too naïve about your situation to recognize how bad it is (if/when it happens).  i was lucky enough to be hired by an amazing manager who hired another woman within 12 months of me (she actually was an intern when i started and came back to the team after her last year of school), so i was almost never the only woman on my team. the men on my team were amazing and i love them dearly - especially one guy who identifies as a feminist and helps check the other guys when they say or do something stupid/sexist just because of ignorance (most people aren't intentionally sexist, they just have unconscious biases), which was really great to not have to be the token angry feminist in the room all the time.   so my experience has been overall not much different from that of men. i have encountered people looking for diversity hires (with good intentions, of having a more diverse workforce, not of checking a box), and i've been on hiring loops where we celebrate that women get offers because it's good of for diversity. most of what i've seen is the small stuff: women being given less technical work, more documentation and meetings; people not seeing their bias when assessing performance (hard to validate specifics, of course); promotions being harder than they need to be because people actually follow the rules when doing the process and just glance over things for some of the men.   one specific incident i've had has been that a manager once gave me feedback to be louder about disagreeing with stuff (a very masculine expectation, as women are socialized to disagree in more subtle ways). when i did he effectively said i had an attitude problem. i don't think he was intentional about it, bit he was also super blind to the obvious bias -- it's literally the textbook example of men are praised for being assertive while women get called bitchy for the same behaviour.   i have heard plenty of stories from people at my company (different teams) where the managers are explicitly blocking women's promos, the teams make blatant sexist jokes (of the ""haha women suck at math"" variety), and not doing code reviews for work and otherwise blocking them for getting work done.  so best advice - find allies who have already seen some of this shit (and other organizational shit like generally bad management) and can tell you when and why it's time to look for another job.",negative

ee3pr36,afy2ae,t3_afy2ae,general experience,335,"i know you asked for a female developer's side, but as a male developer with a ton of female developer friends i felt i'd pitch in too. (however, take all this with a bucket of salt i'm merely a college junior.) most of my friends had absolutely zero trouble getting jobs at top firms (you could argue i only make friends with good developers and i would vehemently deny that allegation) and have had no complaints so far. their co-workers respect them (a few hit on them, but like gentlemen), they couldn't be happier with  their jobs and they are quite satisfied with their salary as well. (none of that paying women less for the same work crap, thank god. )  while i would love to believe all's rosy and we've achieved utopia that is of course not the case. one of my friends still in college does feel men make her feel unwelcome in the major, like her opinion does not matter. however, i have insufficient evidence to corroborate whether those sentiments can be attributed to her being a female or her prowess as a student/developer. that is to say, i don't know if said men look down upon all those they consider unworthy men *and* women, or whether it is her specifically. regardless, since your question was not about college kids at all this is quite besides the point. however, i would like to add: i co-taed a class with a female phd student (i'm an undergrad). before the start of the semester, i was slightly nervous because obviously she had a lot more experience than me and i didn't want to sound stupid or ignorant. my fears proved correct and she was much, much smarter than me. all of us undergrad tas looked up to her and took her word as law, so thankfully it's not like men everywhere are asshats. she deserved our respect and got it, not because of her gender or in spite of her gender, but because she had put in the work and was great at what she did; much better than all of us.   i cannot of course generalize how being a women affected their ability to get the job (and who really knows what goes on in people's heads anyway) because they were pretty darn good developers and even people with a fair amount of bias would have had trouble justifying rejecting them. for men and women, being the best at what you do is the safest way to ensure you get what you want, whether it is easier for men or women is of course open to debate and i have no evidence to support either claim. (not to say there isn't, just that i haven't tried to collect any. )  on a personal level, the gender of my co-worker couldn't matter less to me; their ability as a developer is much, much more important and their character as a human being even more so. if you are a man and a complete shithead, don't come within a 100 feet of me. if you are a woman and a complete shithead, don't come within a 100 feet of me. if you are a man, a great developer and a decent human being, we'll be best friends. if you are a woman, a great developer and a decent human being, we'll be best friends. if you are a woman, a great developer, a decent human being and you happen to find me hot, i have been looking for you my entire life and would jump at the chance to take you out on a date.  just my $0.02, and glad to hear you chose cs and stuck with it! good luck with your first job whenever you get it, and don't let anybody give you crap and get away with it :)",negative

[i was a pregnant intern](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/622ddy/interning_while_pregnant/)!   i did an internship at amazon two summers ago up until my 34th week of pregnancy. got a return offer too. i remember freaking out about amazon and being pregnant but everything turned out fine and amazon was really accommodating.  i spent the summer away from my husband which sucked but he was able to visit and we even did some childcare classes while he was there.   really the only annoying thing was finding prenatal health care, as doctors listed under my insurance provider weren't correctly labeled as obs or even taking new patients. in one case i accidentally called an abortion clinic. 😂 it all worked out in the end though and i was able to come back after the end of my internship and pick up where i left off with my old ob.  i will say everyone's pregnancy is different and how tired you are or how much morning sickness you have will vary. i had none of the latter and very little of the former which definitely helped me finished my internship on a high note.  i will give a word of warning with regards to graduation dates.  i graduated on time but only because i dropped down to the one required class i had left and also got the syllabus before the baby arrived so i could get as much done as possible. babies are similar to pregnancies in that they can vary wildly: some babies are super chill, don't mind laying in a swing for hours, sleep and feed like a dream. other babies (like mine) hate everything and will only sleep while being held. babies like those can make it very difficult to get anything done. you may not have time for a full course load and may need to push back your graduation date. just take it one day at a time and everything will turn out ok. good luck!",positive

ehgbskm,avktvw,t1_ehgav0o,treatment,78,"well that's a different problem for you to deal with now. if i was your manager, no of course i wouldn't bump your salary to 80k after 3 months, but that's because you chose to put yourself in that position, by setting a low starting point for yourself. every raise you get from now on is going to compound from that 50k basis, until you can find a way to reset your career growth and jump to another employer and negotiate for a competitive/equivalent salary as the average candidate might get.  that's why i'm saying, it's going to be very important that you try to reset your salary to the standard level as soon as you can. you yourself probably think you're doing as good a job as an 80k candidate would at this current job, but that 80k guy is gonna become a 100k guy soon, while if you're not careful, you'll be lucky to get from 50k to 70k in your next hop.  if you think you're as good as the next guy, why not get paid like the next guy? and if you struggle to convince others that you're as good as the next guy, and you're not getting offers, then either maybe you're not actually as good as you think, or maybe you're just bad at marketing yourself or negotiating. both are fixable problems, if you encounter them.  good luck.",negative

i have never met a single woman in my life that wanted to program, and the female dev interns we've had did not pursue joining our firm as developers. i don't live in silicon valley or seattle, so i can't speak to areas such as that, or what the stats are nationwide, i'm literally just stating the fact that in my career, i've never personally met any women that wanted to be devs - whilst i've met many guys that did (this is also both inside **and** outside of the office btw). i've seen a couple of times where some guys asked about development, and eventually transitioned into it after a lot of self-teaching. our firm has tons of women in operations and management roles...none of them have made that transition or even asked about making it.  the fact is, there aren't very many women applying for these jobs historically. when they do, they have *at least* as fair of a shot as everyone else, because i can tell you with regards to my office, we'd love to have more women working with us in the dev department. i mean think about it, it's a bunch of computer guys sitting around with nothing to look at except each other lol, j/k. i personally don't feel there is ***any*** ***real*** ***force*** keeping women down in this sector, and neither do my coworkers (we're also a highly diverse international firm, so no, it's *not* always rooms full of just white men in meetings). i also don't feel that anyone can prove otherwise to any of this, and **no**, quoting stats of there not being a lot of women in this field does not mean this is a problem...it just means that women don't want to do the job.  to put things into perspective, why is this discussion not happening around the fact that 91% of nurses in the us are female? what about all those poor guys that are being left out of the picture? who is championing their rights and this obvious prejudice against them that is preventing men from getting hired as nurses!? now does everyone see how absurd the entire discussion is when we simply look at a stat and assume that a low amount of a category of person means that said category must be being discriminated against by the other categories of people in the picture? **it's preposterous.**  just imagine how ridiculous it would sound if people started writing articles about what a ""problem"" it is that there aren't enough male nurses in this nation? lmao. oh, and then if hospitals started creating a ""diversity quota"" to get more men in the door, and this resulted in highly qualified women getting passed over for roles.....? hrmmmm......now imagine you are a female nurse....how irritated might you get over time when all you hear is this being harped on in corporate ""diversity"" emails and continuously in news articles? you might start to get an idea of how that asshole of a manager got to where he is with respect to his opinion on ""diversity hires"".  speaking of corporate mandates again...after **years** of not having a **single** female developer at my firm, we just had back-to-back female dev hires in the past quarter (i have not met them as i no longer work in office, but i have heard of their hiring and which teams they've joined). this is a great thing, and i'm very happy that these young ladies are being successful for themselves. it *does* however reek of filling a quota of sorts because of the statistical unlikelihood of two female developers getting hired in this quick of succession when we've never seen a single one in this office before...wouldn't this suggest that this was a direct result of a ""diversity quota"" and that there had to be men interviewed that were simply discarded because the firm wants to fill a quota? how could anyone say otherwise?  i don't have all of the answers as far as how to ensure that there isn't discrimination when filling roles (and perhaps these quotas are the only way to combat what could be a problem around that), but i certainly *do* know how people get to a point where they are irritated with the whole concept of it.",positive

ewyyj5y,cqowtu,t3_cqowtu,treatment,430,"poc male here with a few years under my belt. i am glad you shared this. you got a great lesson.     what you experienced is a toxic work environment. if you are being hired into a toxic environment it can be hard to change it, especially if you are junior. intern programs are supposed to be a fun and great time, you are giving on of your final summers before you reach true adulthood to work. sometimes you can have a great working environment and relationship. then the company hires person x. x comes in and ruins it for you, x makes the environment toxic. you have to build your ""support"" network. this should be your manager, someone not in your team at all, maybe another random friend.     when they asked what your major was, while you may have felt singled out, they could have just been generally curious. sometimes it's easier to assume positive intent and keep the conversation going. you could always ask back what's your major etc. unfortunately, some of these people have zero black friends and are afraid of talking to black people.     honestly, they were probably talking a lot of smack about you behind your back. a good team will always focus on making you as productive as possible. a part of productivity is happiness and safety. if i hear intern x is making someone less productive or doesn't know software x, as a manager i need to go and coach intern x.   as your career progresses you will meet the same a-holes again and again but each time it gets easier to see through them and/or have productive conversations with them, but as you move up in your career you will need a support network. especially when folks want to pop off/flex/gaslight.     at my last job, there were a bunch of racist tards but i  took photos of slack conversations, got everything in writing, and sent them to my management team every time with some explanation about why this was problematic... and we chatted about it... the company wondered why they had such low retention rates for poc... this is one of the reasons why you have an alarmingly low retention rate because there is this toxic subculture - folks don't feel safe or wanted, ultimately they do not want to be here. i think eventually my manager got it, the world he experiences and i experience at my company is completely different. and all the little things added up.     at least once a week someone had to microaggress - this could be saying something underhanded or simply gaslighting me, bypassing me for question x and going to person y, then ultimately coming to me... the worst is when a random manager x bypasses me and talks to my subordinate and tried to dictate my sprint.     next steps     \- try to set up weekly one on ones with your manager and colleagues. check-in: what should i stop doing, what should i start doing, how was your weekend, what new software excites you? the goal is to establish a safe feedback loop. maybe your manager will say yeah you need to do more of x. it also helps you build rapport. write down the start and stop and check in again next time, have i made progress on x? if your manager is any good they'll be open and honest with your progress. i think engineers love to see progress if they can say you came in knowing a little bit of x and now you are leading the project on x then it's a great thing to share. even if you struggle and have some difficulty just the simple fact that you made progress and tried is huge.     \- understand what you need to be minimally productive at your job do you need a good understanding of maven, npm,  unit testing, git, etc.? git is kind of like a basic requirement for most engineers. you mention you don't know git, command line, terminal. no offense i think these are pretty critical in any job to be productive you need to have some understanding how to use them. spend some time getting better using these tools.     \- next time seek out a few mentors, you mentioned you enjoyed talking to women seek out the highest of mentors i.e. vp/c-suite mentor (they probably will not have time but they can direct you to someone who might). the reason you want to go high up is usually these folks have seen a bunch of stuff and they usually can help. they are usually closer to the company's moral/value/strategy and should embody those.",positive

that may have been true in 1980, but it sure isn't true now, except for a small subset of absolute losers. do not ever accept this as a defense of someone's behavior. cs people are regular people with regular jobs. most have significant others, children, friends, etc. many companies i've worked at the white males are the minority. there are definitely less women in cs than men, but that's changing over the years. i will say that african americans are definitely in the minority in cs. lots of koreans, lots of indians, pakistanis, chinese, etc. not so many african americans. it's something that needs to change and probably relates more to societal issues than anything else. it's awesome that you're there, and please, please don't give up.  in 20 years in cs, i've never been in a team that didn't include at least some women and i've never been in a team that was all white. and i've also never been at a company where if hr found out that white and asian guys were talking down to women or to people of color they wouldn't immediately get a talking to and placed on probation.  there are shitty people everyone, sadly. you could've had this same experience as a new accountant.  however:  * many jobs won't hold your hand and the people there won't answer your questions right away unless you're pushy. they're busy with their jobs. they figured this shit out on their own and they expect you to do the same. my first day at a job i was placed on a conference call with a vendor that included 20 experienced people on our side and 5-6 people on their side, and i was expected to run the entire call myself, with all my coworkers just listening in as i went through a list of problems i'd never seen before and demanded answers from the software vendor. that experience is not abnormal * occasionally an intern will be found to be a complete waste of air, at which point some managers (not good ones, but still...) will be openly annoyed at this waste of space on their team and will publicly talk about how bad the person is when that person isn't around. that's life, some people really are that incompetent. i hired a new cs grad with a bs and ms in cs who had good grades who i quickly discovered was so incompetent that i question whether his mom had to tie his shoes for him each morning. i wouldn't trust that guy to write a simple ""for"" loop for me. just because they're talking that way about someone else isn't your concern (although, again, obviously a good manager should never openly discuss that type of thing, but realistically it does happen in many places, since everyone can see how much of an idiot that person is) * if a dev is in the room and hears a question they know the answer to, they'll frequently interrupt and give the answer. bad, but true. get over it and don't take it personally unless you are 110% sure they never do it to anyone else, and only to you. chance are, they do it to anyone, because they know the answer (or think they do) * sadly, many cs in meetings (even small ones) don't look anyone in the eye as they talk. on the plus side, they'll probably also never advance in their careers * interns are frequently talked down to by full timers, especially if they ask a bunch of questions instead of figuring things out for themselves  now, all that being said, there is a very real chance that only you were getting treated that way there, and that it was because of your race and your gender. i fully admit that can and does happen, and it sounds like it did happen to you, which sucks. i just want you to know that even once you find a good place to work that won't second guess you or treat you differently due to your race/gender, you'll still probably see some of the things i listed above, so please don't take those things alone as a sign that the company is bad. there's no argument to be made for most of the other things that you listed, they're just treating you shitty.  i will say this -- the real world is just like the playground. the strong feed on the weak. if you're the type of person to cry about it in the bathroom, they'll know, and they'll talk down to you and eat you for lunch. it's probably a cultural thing, but those white males know that were they treated like that they'd get mad, not sad, and they'd fight, not cry, and so they look down at people who weren't raised the exact middle-class private school way they were raised. and if a white male intern cried in the bathroom after being talked over and ignored they would probably write that person off as well. it's the unearned confidence of the middle class white male, and it's not your fault, but you have to work with them so you should understand that they expect everyone else to have that unearned sense of self confidence just like they do  you need to find another job. they won't all be like this, i promise. please don't let 1 (or, god forbid, 2) bad experiences kill your enthusiasm and optimism",positive

ex1cs5f,cqowtu,t3_cqowtu,treatment,430,"so a few things, from a brown woman who's been working in the industry for a while now:  * there's good places and bad places to work at. you seem to have worked at a bad place, judging by people trashing employees and there bring a high churn rate.   * if it's not an organized internship program, the intern is the lowest on the totem pole. you're checking out the place as much as they are checking you out, so you know now where not to work.   * people can be dismissive or awkward, often because they don't know how to relate to you. for instance, a bunch of us new employees, mostly asian and indian, were meeting with our division head, a white guy. the conversation was awkward and stilted, until this black guy who was from the same city as the division head joined us, and he and the boss got along really well and talked a lot about sports. the rest of us didn't follow football and just watched in wonder. i find tech less racist than a lot of other jobs; it seems to be more about if you find some way to be relatable. i usually bring up tech news and stock market stuff to make small talk. it's inoffensive, relatable topics, and i'm also often just genuinely curious about getting someone else's take on some industry happenings.   * asking questions/having someone explain things to you can be hit or miss. i too struggle with this. usually interns or new employees get matched with a mentor who they can direct all their questions to. smaller companies might not have that. it's always better to ask as much as you can when you're new because people are more patient with you. over time, though, i've realized that the most successful people just take initiative and try to make themselves useful wherever there's something needing to be done. don't always wait around to be assigned to some stuff. it's okay to do that, but you become more successful if you look at what your team is struggling with and try to help.   * there's a lot of racist attitudes. it's a losing battle to fight them directly and go through proper channels all the time, because a lot of the time, the shit people do is subtle. i've experienced this the most with white women. it feels like a losing battle dealing with them.  * but despair not, there's ways to deal with it. what you need to do is to go to every fucking diversity event and network your ass off. it might seem like useless stuff, but the talks and panel discussions aren't the point. the point is to go find your allies and network with them in peace time, so when it's war, you have your troops ready. have informal channels open with people across levels. that way, when some shit goes down, you can talk about it with those allies, get advice, and they have your back. before you make an official complaint, you want your mentors/allies to already know your side of things and give you advice on what moves to make.  * for better or worse, tech is one of the few places where you can make a good wage even while not bring a rockstar these days. so stick with tech. money is very very very important. negotiate the hell out of your salary and save like a maniac. it can take a couple of years, sometimes more to find your footing. it took me four. power through it. once you have accrued some credibility, skills and money, you get a lot more freedom to do more great things.   * look for jobs at companies where there's a lot of middle aged women. those are the good places to work at, because they'll have sane hours. sane hours leads to more diversity, and actual meaningful diversity where it's not just young people who are desperate to prove themselves.   * work your ass off. despite all the naysaying, i'll say that working hard/smart actually leads to better results in a tech career. just make sure to also talk about all the work you're doing.",positive

(the ceo even asked me if i was old enough to drink, because we have monthly happy hours). i bonded with my team to the point that they asked for me to be their leader in one of our retrospectives. i start as software engineering manager tuesday, and am so excited. i hope you can experience a success like this as well.",positive

eyrfqd2,cycwst,t3_cycwst,treatment,5,"i think a big problem we all face at one point in our lives is self-fufilling prophecies. whenever we start doubting in ourselves or have low self-esteem, we often take actions that someone who is not competent in said area would do. for instance, someone who thinks he sucks at software engineering might not apply to certain jobs because he feels he isn't good enough and will only stick to entry-level jobs. since he gets stuck with entry-level jobs, it then confirms his initial thought that he isn't good enough.  when it comes to leadership, you really have to have a confident energy that others will feel. if you want to be a leader but aren't confident, no one will take you seriously. i know this may be very hard to do, but you need to find ways to confirm your worth and start thinking and acting the way you are actually worth.  i understand you may feel like being a women is negatively impacting you, but i believe this is the main problem in fields with less women. what everyone keeps saying is that women won't be taking seriously and that they will be victims of sexism in stem. this might be very true with certain collegues, but not everyone thinks like that. if you fall for that narrative, you lost before you even tried. if you start thinking that you gender is impacting your chances of getting a promotion, you probably will behave in a certain way that someone who isn't confident would. this then sends the message to everyone else that you aren't ready to be a leader.   my best piece of advice is to try to forget all the things media tries to tell you. you are not a victim. you can be who you want to be. if you want to be a leader, start believing that you can do it. otherwise, you'll never be able to be a leader.",positive

[...]  [...]for him, white benevolence denies black people the pride of achievement. by contrast, if one is black and overcomes the barriers of jim crow, one can be assured that the accomplishment is real. thomas often invokes the example of his grandparents, who, despite segregation, managed to acquire property and support their family. though they “had to work twice as hard to get half as far,” they knew, however far they got, that the distance was theirs. when black people succeed in the shadow of white benefactors, that certainty is lost.  https://www.newyorker.com/culture/essay/clarence-thomass-radical-vision-of-race",positive

f853lo8,dysvud,t3_dysvud,treatment,660,"(i'm a guy)  this is one of those really tough cases. the tech industry is (over all) still pretty sexist and often unfair to women. sometimes (often?) people will engage in completely tone-deaf and inappropriate actions to ""try to fix it"". you're definitely describing some of these.  my advice is:  1. find some other women in the industry to talk to. ideally some who have been around for at least a few years and can help you figure out what's normal, what isn't, what needs to be actively worried about, and can support/commiserate with you. 2. find a more senior engineer at your company **who you trust** who can act as your [sponsor](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/sponsors-vs-mentors-whats-difference-infographic). 3. keep your eyes open for a better team. being the only $foo on a team can be very tough and usually isn't a good role for a new grad. when you interview places try to figure out if you'd be the only woman (on the company, team, or in that role). if so, ask yourself seriously if it's a good place to be. it might be. but if it really is a good/healthy environment why are there no women there yet? maybe it's just odds since they're under-represented in the industry, or maybe its because the environment is (possibly unconsciously) hostile to women.  for all the guys reading this post, please listen to the op and others here. our industry can still be pretty terrible to women. everyone (yes, everyone) has unconscious biases and if we have to start by recognizing them. if you pride yourself in making rational, fair, decisions, then it's important that you actually examine yourself and make sure you really are. most people don't. we can do better. one of the big things to remember is that *we men* have to fix this. we're still usually the ones in the majority and in the more senior and powerful roles. it is deeply unfair to push fixing this onto the very people who are being hurt by the status quo.  finally, for those people who still believe the falsehood that the only way to hire lots of women is to lower the bar. my current team at work is a specialist group. we (literally) write, maintain, and review the cryptographic code that amazon uses. we need to be (and are) frighteningly competent and on a daily basis are working on everything from x86 assembly, to python, to c, to [dafny](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dafny-a-language-and-program-verifier-for-functional-correctness/), to threat modeling, to massive upgrade campaigns.  [we're also only about 50% men](https://twitter.com/jamieelisea/status/1180924788690186240). i believe that this is directly related to why our team is so skilled. we do actively recruit people based on their skills and potential. and, since skills and ability are evenly distributed, that means that if we were highly skewed (such as 80+% men), then that would be evidence we are likely passing over skilled women/non-binary hires in favor of men.  by being supportive and respectful of *all* our members we've built a better and stronger team.  it will take a while for our industry to get where it needs to. but we can get there. it will take work. importantly, it will take everyone's work. we can't push this work onto the various under-represented groups or onto a few diversity initiatives. we all need to do it.",positive

f849nbl,dysvud,t3_dysvud,treatment,660,"so, i've been in the industry going on 8 years now at major companies, and i can give some insight into why they're acting like this.   the root of the problem is that, whyever tech became an industry dominated by men, now it's a self-perpetuating problem. women don't go into tech because it's an industry without many women, and so the cycle continues. no one wants to be the first person of their gender on a team or an org with an established culture that's probably at least a little sexist. no one wants to be the canary in the coal mine who gets to find out which managers are creeps.   at every step of the process through picking the career, going through college, interning, starting at the job, and working up through the ranks, more and more of the few women who pick the path drop off it. and the more women are a minority, the more men get away with the sort of bullshit you get away with when you're the majority. and again the cycle self-perpetuates.   so how do you break the cycle?   well, one way is to have a policy of just fucking making *sure* that women are included in things. make sure you're hiring them, and make sure the ones you hire are visible. game the system, prime the pump.   it's a shitty plan, because it requires women who have already swam up a river of bullshit into the industry to stick their necks out once again. but the thing is, no one's really thought of a *better* plan. hoping the problem solves itself doesn't work, clearly. ignoring it entrenches it. and if you ask women to volunteer for that, few do, but fewer men are comfortable with asking anyways so that system collapses.   so essentially, this is an apology. sorry for the fucked-up system we built, we didn't mean to. sorry for volunteering you to be brave, but at this point it is genuinely motivated by an effort to fix the problem. hopefully the short-term pain ends fast and the long-term gain starts soon. and thank you for being one of the ones who stuck it out. you *are* turning the tide. the industry *is* changing, for the better. i've seen it firsthand.",positive

(and in the end that makes my job easier when raises come around after a year)  4. and after that sometimes the thumb goes on the scale. my interview rate for diverse candidates is decent but i still see 3 - 4 men for every woman that applies. all else being equal i'll often choose the most diverse candidate.",negative

""privilege"" on the other hand allows me to ask the question: ""would i be where i am if i wasn't a white male?"". and sadly i don't think i would be. there are tons of examples of where i know i'm seen as the default, as safe.  no one gets fired for hiring another white male manager. no one really scrutinizes me specifically for mistakes.  in my experience that is not always true of people who are different whether they be of a different race, gender, culture or whatever.    if you help every unassertive or lowballing person, and more of them happen to be women, great. if you only help women, not great.  my most recent developer hire is a guy who thought he wasn't good enough coming out of college, did odd jobs and lived in a rented room in someone's house for two years. he passed our coding test easily and then still said he'd take 20% less than our minimum for juniors when we asked how much he was looking for (we didn't accept that and paid him a market rate). he's probably the most non-assertive person i've ever met. yet in four months he's already been able to take the lead on two projects and he's a fantastic developer who's going to get paid when raises come around.  previous to us he didn't have a ton of luck with interviews and i think it was because he's not very assertive.  i also recently hired a woman as a ba/qa who is exactly the opposite. she's confident and assertive in a way that scares and confuses my primarily boomer owners. i hired her specifically for that reason, because sometimes an old company needs things shaken up :)",negative

facwwgf,e8h6dq,t3_e8h6dq,treatment,482,"hello. as a fellow woman in tech who has also worked on an all male team, here is the advice i have:  he probably does have good intentions like you said, and the fact that he has already acknowledged you as a minority on the team puts you in a good position, because now you can convey how you feel as the sole depress of that minority in your workspace.  i would definitely wait for this person to be somewhere you can speak privately, don’t draw attention to the situation to others, and don’t email because your tone may get misconstrued. i would say something like this:  “hey name, i just want to say that i have noticed that you take care to promote inclusivity here in the office, especially because ‘as you said’ i am a minority here. i appreciate your effort, however prior to the teams merging i already felt like a valid and productive employee. i cannot speak for all women of course, however personally it makes me uncomfortable when attention is brought to my gender, and when interjections such as “or she!” are stated when someone uses “he” as a general term, because since i’m the only women in the office, it’s the equivalent of say “it could be any guy in the office, or karen”. if there were more women in the office the push for inclusivity would make sense, but since it is only me, it just creates a further rift by singling me out.”  instead of karen say your name, but i feel like the last part would really make him see what you mean. also, a benefit of face to face is you can do damage control with his initial reaction. if he reacts badly you can ask him why he feels that way and get more information.   it’s just a matter of communicating clearly. i would also point out that you want to be “brought attention to for my work, or not at all”",positive

(now keep in mind, i was also raised by an awesome, no bs, progressive, feminist mother.)  turns out, some of the ladies didn't think i was speaking ""nice"" enough to people. that plus water cooler talk combined with some white knights jumping in to defend almost landed me in hot water.   so we got ahead of the problem and had a sit down with hr, who said, ""ya know the thing i love about you? you're blind to race/religion/gender etc all that. you treat everyone exactly the same. so it makes figuring out your intent easy. you're the exact same amount of asshole to everyone! but what i need you to do is actually pay attention to the stereotypes, because they are there for a reason, and be more gentle in the way you talk to stereotypically more sensitive people, at least until they signal otherwise. best to err on the side of a overly nice than to have an hr issue.""  of course, this frustrates me a little, because i'm not the type to handhold or coddle my employees. you're here because i know you're capable of doing your job. but i end up a little more like the guy you're describing (not to that extreme) and haven't had an issue since.  of course, most employees signal for me to cut the shit real quick, which i gladly do. but the ones that haven't, i dunno, i guess they like being spoken to that way? i don't get it and it's weird to me. it might just have something to do with the whole fake-nice facsade that people keep up to each other's faces here in the southern states. but it works, so i do what i have to, even if it feels super over the top to me.",positive

fac89sg,e8h6dq,t3_e8h6dq,treatment,482,"i had a similar experience in the army, where in my first unit i was fresh out of college (young and green) and one of four girls in my entire combat arms battalion (~300 people in the unit). i worked hard and proved my ability to keep up regularly and most of the time my gender was a non-issue (surprisingly, although i did have to work a lot harder to prove myself). anyway, the only time it was an issue was when 'that one guy' drew attention to the fact that i wasn't a dude. unfortunately, all it takes is one person drawing attention to turn a non-issue into an issue. especially if the co-worker you speak of is in a position of authority.  i've always taken a direct approach to these kinds of things- kind but firm and unemotional in my delivery. i would pull someone aside and ask a question like, ""hey, based on *x/y/z* comments you've made lately, i'm wondering if you think that i don't feel like a respected member of the team. is that a correct perception?"" this hopefully leads to a dialog about the matter, which gives you some perspective on his thinking. the other, more passive approach that you can take is to make a comment about how much you have always felt like a valuable member of the team, although this can be tricky because your co-worker could perceive it as you being glad that he's always pointing out your... 'difference'. i always recommend a more direct approach to lessen the chances of things getting lost in translation.  i don't think it's unusual that you're starting to read into things. it's a baader-meinhof phenomenon kinda thing and i think it's totally normal. you clearly understand your worth and have been shown respect up to this point, which means your co-workers have understood your worth to this point as well. keep that in mind, even when it's tough. however, i would definitely not just let this go because that same perception you're starting to have of feeling more like an outsider could also start to permeate your other co-workers, even without them realizing it. words are powerful. if you're feeling nervous, perhaps talk to a trusted co-worker to get his perspective on the matter. but at the end of the day, your comfort in your own workplace is important and you have every right to discuss the issue until it is resolved.",positive

(i don't know if this is because of my gender, or because i generally had a shy personality, or what.)  both of them ended up going into cs--but why? who told them what it was and suggested it might be a good fit? is this the message i would have received if i'd been a boy? or is this the message i would have received if i hadn't been interested in other things, too, like art and biology?  in any case, i made sure my little sister wasn't left in the dark like i was. when she told me that math was her favorite subject in school, i gently pushed her to take a coding class in high school (they never offered that when *i* was there!). and now that's what she does for a living and, from what i can gather, she'd damn good at her job.  as for myself, i ended up dropping out of academia because i'm too introverted and noncompetitive to hack it as a scientist. i now work in the private sector, doing agricultural research. it's fine and i like it, but if i could do it all again, i'd be either a programmer or an electrician today.",negative

[https://www.webmd.com/brain/features/how-male-female-brains-differ#2](https://www.webmd.com/brain/features/how-male-female-brains-differ#2)  women have more connections going left and right across the two halves of the brain. this could give them an advantage in pulling together information from different sources and drawing conclusions.      men's brains have more connections from front to back, which may heighten their perception. they may be more attuned to what's going on around them so they can take action. men have stronger connections between brain areas for motor and spatial skills. that means males tend to do a better job at tasks that need hand-eye coordination and understanding where objects are in space, such as throwing a ball or hammering a nail.  which is also another reason why we have separate sport leagues for men and women and why most men are stronger than most women.  and here's the kicker:  mris showed the biggest gaps between the sexes were the larger amount of gray matter women had in their hippocampus, a structure that plays a role in memory, and the left caudate, which is thought to control our communication skills. verma found that in female brains, there's more wiring in regions linked to memory and social cognition. so is it surprising that women tend to be better at understanding how other people are feeling and knowing the right way to respond in social situations?  hence the reason why women tend to be better with people (nursing) and men tend to be better with things (engineering, technology)  sorry, if you want me to treat you differently and give you special treatment because you're a woman, it simply is not happening.",negative

(kobak 1999)  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4771005/  1.  a 2013 canadian study (allen 2013), which analyzed data from a very large population-based sample, revealed that the children of gay and lesbian couples are only about 65 percent as likely to have graduated from high school as are the children of married, opposite-sex couples. the girls are more apt to struggle academically than the boys. daughters of lesbian “parents” displayed dramatically lower graduation rates. three key findings stood out in this study: children of married, opposite-sex parents have a high graduation rate compared to the others; children of lesbian families have a very low graduation rate compared to the others; and children in the other four types of living arrangements (common law marriage, gay couple, single mother, and single father) are similar to each other and fall between the extremes of married heterosexual parents and lesbian couples. 2.  a study of 174 primary school children in australia (sarantakos 1996) compared the social and educational development of 58 children living in married families, 58 living with cohabiting heterosexuals, and 58 living in homosexual unions. the authors found that married couples offer the best environment for a child's social and educational development, followed by cohabiting heterosexual couples and lastly by homosexual couples. 3.  in a study (goldberg 2007) of 36 adults raised by lesbian, gay, and bisexual (lgb) parents, 15 of them (42%) described challenges relating to their ability to trust other people. 4.  a study (sirota 2009) of 68 women with gay or bisexual fathers and 68 women with heterosexual fathers found a statistically significant difference between the two groups. the women (whose average age in both groups was 29) with gay or bisexual fathers had difficulty with adult attachment issues in three areas: (1) they were less comfortable with closeness and intimacy; (2) they were less able to trust and depend on others; and (3) they experienced more anxiety in relationships compared to the women raised by heterosexual fathers (and mothers). 5.  a study (potter 2012) in the journal of marriage and family, found that “children in same-sex parent families scored lower than their peers living in married, two-biological parent households” on two academic outcomes. potter concluded that these differences can be attributed to higher levels of family instability in cohabiting or “married” same-sex families, compared to intact, biological married parent families. the study was based on a large, nationally representative, and random survey of school-age children. 6.  in a 2012 re-examination of a 2010 study by rosenfeld (allen et al. 2012) on the association between child outcomes and same-sex family structure, the researchers found that compared with traditional married households, children being raised by same-sex couples were 35 percent less likely to make normal progress through school. this difference is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. the conclusion of this important research—that “with respect to normal school progress, children residing in same-sex households can be distinguished statistically from those in traditional married homes and in heterosexual cohabiting households”—is consistent with sarantakos’ well-designed study of 174 primary school children in australia.  7.  a ground-breaking study from the university of texas at austin (regnerus 2012) found that young-adult children (ages 18–39) of parents who had same-sex relationships before the subjects had reached the age of 18 were more likely to suffer from a broad range of emotional and social problems. the study is noteworthy for several reasons: (1) his study sample was large, representative, and population-based (not a small, self-selected group); (2) regnerus studied the responses of adult children rather than asking same-sex parents to describe how their young dependent children are doing; and (3) he was able to draw comparisons on up to 80 measures for children who had lived with (or had) parents who fell into one of eight categories—intact families with both biological parents who were married to each other, lesbian mothers, gay fathers, heterosexual single parents, parents who later divorced, cohabiting parents, parents who adopted the respondent, and other (such as a deceased parent). the children of lesbians and gays fared worse than those in intact heterosexual families on 77 of the 80 outcome measures. exceptions related only to the voting habits of children with gay fathers, and alcohol use by children of lesbian mothers. 8.  in recent years, married or cohabiting gay and lesbian couples have acquired children through artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization. research published in 2010 (marquardt et al. 2010) demonstrated some of the negative consequences to donor-conceived individuals: on average, young adults conceived through artificial insemination were more confused, felt more isolated from their families, were experiencing more psychic pain, and fared worse in areas such as depression, delinquency, and substance abuse than a matched group of children who were conceived naturally. 9.  men in gay unions are now also seeking biologically related children through the use of surrogate mothers. a 2013 study of children conceived through surrogate mothers by (golombok et al. 2013) comparing them to children born through egg donation, donor insemination, and natural conception. the children were evaluated at ages 3, 7, and 10. the study demonstrated that children gestated by a surrogate had higher adjustment difficulties at age 7 than the other children. the authors concluded that the absence of a gestational connection to the mother may be problematic for children. the lead researcher stated, “signs of adjustment problems could be behaviour problems, such as aggressive or antisocial behaviour, or emotional problems, such as anxiety or depression.” 10.  in a 2015 study (sullins 2015a) using a representative sample of 207,007 children, including 512 with same-sex parents, from the us national health interview survey, emotional problems were over twice as prevalent (minimum risk ratio (rr) 2.4, 95%confidence interval (ci) 1.7–3.0) for children with same-sex parents than for children with opposite-sex parents. 11.  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was more than twice (rr 2.4, 95% ci 1.6–3.4) as prevalent among children with same-sex parents than in the general population, after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and parent socio-economic status (sullins 2015b).",negative

fbkwwkg,edqtrq,t3_edqtrq,treatment,378,"hey, m poc here (black).  i've only been working for about 5 and a half years as a programmer, but i felt a lot of what you're feeling now.  as they say, **you are your own biggest critic,** but **you also need to be your own biggest advocate**.  realize that negative experiences are internally magnified 100x.  yes, missing a deadline isn't the best look and may reflect negatively on you, but as long as it doesn't become the norm, you will still be dwelling on it long after everyone else has forgotten.  **skill improvement advice:**  what are your current pain points?  is it framework related? is your code buggy / churning through a lot of qa cycles? are requirements hard to understand? either way, the first thing to do is identify where you believe your deficiencies are and go from there.  if it's 3rd party framework related, the documentation + youtube should explain the structure of the framework, so then the exercise becomes finding the seams between your company code and framework code.  once you know what belongs to what, it is easier to get a general idea of what belongs where, and what code is responsible for certain actions.  generally a codebase has a patterned example of what you need to do, so stepping through that can show you how  to at least structure your code.  if it is still nebulous, you should form a targeted question and ask a senior member to explain it to you.  don't ask something general like ""i don't know how the xyz module works"". ask something pointed and specific like ""i see where the id record goes into the function here, but i don't understand how the abc value is being calculated"".  many engineers will never stop thinking that they are smarter than you, so leverage their ""infinite wisdom"" to gain understanding.  if they refuse to help, go to someone else.  if everyone else refuses to help, polish the resume off and start applying elsewhere.  stepping through code one call at a time and mentally checking your understanding will help you break down a system. get comfortable with your debug tools, they are your best friend.  have a notebook, write and diagram it as you work because 1: notebooks with boxes and arrows make you look like hot shit and, more seriously 2: you're brain will often trick you into thinking 'yea i understand that', but if you can't put it down on paper you may realize there are blind spots in your understanding.  take a pluralsight, udemy, or any other coding site course to skill up. sometimes running from a beginner to intermediate course is adequate to fill in gaps that might not have been covered in school.  it is humbling to have to listen to ""this is how to declare a variable"" a few times, but no one retains 100% of everything on the first pass.  many workplaces have a learning budget or work accounts to programs like this, but if they don't, many of those sites offer free trials.  you may need to do it ""on your own time"", but you will pick up things to bring back to work and bring undeniable experience to the company.  **social advice:**  know who you have to please, and who you don't. if joe schmoe is giving you some side eye but isn't impacting your work and isn't being abusive, put him out of your mind.  i'm not saying be mean or standoffish, but try not to dwell on what you think his thoughts are.  utilizing the targeted questions stuff mentioned above, when you go to interact with your peers, it will be evident that you have done your homework, and it will be harder for them to just hand wave you off and say ""look deeper"".  unfortunately, management often only sees metrics and burn downs. keep track of project times, and if something looks like it risks going over, maybe meet with management to see if they can either extend the deadline, or divert more resources to helping out.  there's nothing wrong with needing help sometimes, as estimates are almost always wrong.  sometimes the difference between a missed deadline and an early delivery is some value in a spreadsheet.  about half way through a project, you should have an idea of whether or not you are tracking for on time delivery, so speak up then and usually things can be moved. just be sure again to have pointed reasons as to why the remaining work will take longer than forecasted. it doesn't matter than someone else might be able to do it faster; it's your task, and it will take *you* however long *you* need to diligently deliver a good product.  there are often smaller easier 'busy tasks' in a backlog. it looks good to knock out a few of these backlog items which are usually not glamorous or highly monotonous (think code reformatting, fixing typos etc) but increasing the number of things accomplished always looks good on paper.   **mental health advice:**  notice i haven't mentioned much about being a poc yet.  that's very intentional because, like this response, i believe that about 2/3 of your doubts can be solved by becoming more secure in your own ability with conscious improvement. it doesn't matter where you're starting out, but with a conscious effort to get better, you will grow past many of the people who sit back and judge.  that last 3rd though, never goes away. you will still slip up and make mistakes, and you will from time to time think about how it reflects on your race and abilities.  sure, sometimes people may underestimate you because of who you are, but use that opportunity to exceed their expectation. do better than they ever expected of you, and they will take notice. you will still occasionally need to vent, and you will get angry, but don't let those moments spiral you into self pity. focus on being undeniably the best that you can be, and people will have no choice but to take notice.",positive

fbml2nd,edqtrq,t3_edqtrq,treatment,378,"spotlight syndrome and imposter syndrome are most likely the culprit. but, that isnt to say you aren't also or only experiencing genuine  bias of some kind. please be aware, my advice here is not to dismiss that. be sure to ask yourself the right questions.  i struggled and still do sometimes with this spotlight and imposter syndrome. my first word of advice, be direct.  first identify fact and separate those from feeling.  if you haven't received direct feedback with words telling you you've done something wrong. avoid thinking someone has prerogative not to. having a diversity hire does not inspire anyone to hire a person they believe cant do the job. keeping a diversity hire does not merit some amazing reward that someone would not be explicit about your poor performance or decide to avoid your termination. it's far more likely the opposite is true.  in fact, you probably regularly receive compliments on your work but dismiss them as people being nice. people find compliments even more awkward than giving negative feedback.  if you are recieving consistent negative feedback. there are only three possibilities, you work for an asshole, you need some time training, or, most likely, someone is genuinely investing in your growth.  i've noticed that my associates are more willing to help a diversity hire than their middle aged white boring guy (i happen to be one myself) this can easily be misinterpreted, and if it is causing you anxiety. shut that shit down. its not your responsibility to make them get warm and fuzzies. if it's not really an option, get a different job.   your going to be learning your whole career, time in the field isnt what is important. curiosity, empathy, and integrity are. dont be afraid to admit your wheels are spinning, its genuinely bad for your health. if you burnout from spinning your wheels... you'll be actually dysfunctional for a while. i.e the harder you push uncomfortably, the harder it will be to recover.  so here's my actual advice, outside of rant.  take a step back, imagine you are the best developer in the world, and write down how the feedback you received would make you feel. now write down how you actually feel.  now, disregarding matters of perception of others, differentiate exactly how you differ from that perfect developer in your own opinion.  now, consider your coworkers, how do they differ? good news is, this is how people are actually perceived by others. if there is something more there. leave, it's not your fault, problem, or responsibility to fix. unless for some reason you want to.  when/if you decide it's bad. let me know, i can help you find a job (same goes for anyone else here.    i wish i could tell you bias doesn't exist, but that's untrue. but do yourself a favor and look internally first, if you cant find what you're looking for. journal or record what's happening and get a second opinion, try to get someone who doesn't work at your company, is not biased themselves, and will be candid with you. a therapist might help, but you could also know someone.  if you're being mistreated leave, if it's really bad, sue their pants off.  this is a good set of info regarding imposter syndrome and spotlight syndrome.  https://impostorsyndrome.com/10-steps-overcome-impostor/  https://effectiviology.com/spotlight-effect-stop-being-self-conscious/    i wish you the best. also, we are hiring. and we don't care about much of anything other than some proof that you are a systems thinker, enjoy working on complex human and computer problems, are curious, personable, professional, have integrity, and are very very curious. which, is alot harder to find than you might think.",positive

""only asians with successful backgrounds were allowed to immigrate""  and then they were forced to work on railroads. what exactly does ""having a successful background"" matter when you work inhumane hours on a railroad all day? are you trying to claim their success was genetic?   statiscally, asians are more successful than white people, as are indians and jews. here is evidence.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_united_states_by_household_income   some of black america's problems are their own, as with any group. but the largest issue is not their fault, it is the flawed welfare system with inhumane requirements that incentive single motherhood.  my solution is to simply get rid of welfare requirements, like taking away benefits from a woman living with the father of her child.   the income gap between two parent black household and two parents white households is far less and much more similar to the gap between white households and asian households. such differences could then be attributed to parenting methods, children of parents who emphasize school and offer more stability tend to have more successful children. racism has nothing to do with it.    if you mean the wealth gap, well obviously after decades of 70 percent single motherhood, of course black intergenerational wealth is going to be a lot lower. you stop that, you stop single motherhood, and of course things will get better. that's the issue though, not racism.   if racism against non white truly exists at an institutional level in america, it would not have been possible for indians and asians to become more successful than whites in their own country.   that study is flawed for a number of reasons. first, the gap between male and female sentences for the same crime is far greater than the black and white gap. do you also believe that their is institutional misandry in america?   https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx   second, a judge decides their sentence not just on the perpetrator's history but on their court conduct and their likelihood to reoffend. if an individual has multiple family members in jail or possible gang affiliations, that increases that likelihood.   third, there are justice department studies that totally contradict that one you linked.  https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?id=174599  https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/high-incarceration-rate-blacks-function-crime-not-racism-1479.html  a 1994 justice department survey of felony cases from the country’s 75 largest urban areas discovered that blacks actually had a lower chance of prosecution after a felony than whites did and that they were less likely to be found guilty at trial. after conviction, blacks were more likely to receive prison sentences, however — an outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records",negative

""a implies b, but i don't like b, so a must be wrong!"".  your logic: ""tests differentiate people. racists differentiate people. tests must be racist"".  for you, agreeing with iq tests puts someone in the same category with nazis. what a fucking great method of identification.  i believe, you seriously hold your opinions, but to me, it was clear from the get-go what kind of a person you are on this matter. you threw in racism before anything when started to talk about iq tests. no science, or anything. just racism. i knew what to expect, and that's why i initiated. (and can't even explain how iq tests are racist! just saying racists used them in the past). your first comment on iq tests was blended in political agenda right off the bat and it was screaming insecurity.  with my all sincerity and heart, i recommend you this: i understand contemporary politics is fucked up, but when you are choosing what to believe or not, don't peek at its consequences, don't consider who else holds that opinion or the opposite. if it is a factual statement, those things won't matter. otherwise, all those are reasoning fallacies and you will be biased.  edit: i see some up and down -votes for either of us. if any other people know, whether this opinion of iq tests being bullsh\*t is also common in anywhere else in the world, or is it just the us, could you let me know please? it is my assumption that these opinions arise from the us politics.",negative
