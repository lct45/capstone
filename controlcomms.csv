""bagels"" == true, and ""bagels"" == 0, but of course, true != 0, because nothing's transitive in php.  what's the value of null? because null < -1 is true, and so is null == 0.  have an object objthing? well, guess what, objthing  999999999999999, because why the hell not.  and some functions have in-built gotchas that actively work against you. ""0"" == false, but str\_pos returns 0 if the character does exist, but in the first index - good luck always remembering to check that at every single point!  oh, let's talk about str\_pos, which searches a string, and array\_search, which searches an array! you think they'd have similar inputs - a needle and a haystack. and sure - except that str\_pos is ($haystack, $needle) while array\_search is ($needle, $haystack) for some godforsaken reason.  how is an integer overflow handled? ...by converting it to a float. sounds useful, until you want to interact with literally anything that actually requires an integer, and breaks because php silently tries to help, like a fucked-up dobby gremlin hidden in your code.  are names case-sensitive? i dunno, depends on how php feels that day. functions? go wild! variables? hell no. keywords? sure! constants? die in a fire!  and since there's no type safety, you have no way, except for years of knowledge about how php handles specific situations, to detect the kind of madness that arises from a developer accidentally passing a function a string instead of an int, or an object instead of an array.  why the hell does ""include"" even exist? ""require"" is 100% intrinsically superior, because i can't imagine a time where you want to include another set of code, but don't actually care if it happens, unless you're doing some insane shenanigans.  good luck trying to parallelize anything in php!  and all php functions are accessible from the global namespace - hell, they didn't even have namespacing until php 5.3, and i'm still supporting shit made before that!  and php now has object-oriented programming. yay? but this is where i come back to your comparison to java.  php stole lower-level java's object and class management system, and yet, somehow managed to make it even worse. classes aren't objects, they just have a string name. they can never look like objects - good luck meta-programming with them.  but overall, it's the philosophy behind php that i hate the most. the idea that, no matter what, the program must not die, and the show must go on, no matter how twisted, wrong or mangled the data becomes. and that's a problem - a well-oiled machine should have safety mechanisms to disengage when it, and php is very poor at providing the tools that work with developers to find errors and stop them before they happen. ""always run, no matter what"" is great for newbie developers doing quick, dirty work, but it's awful for larger systems.",blank

fj9alv9,fc67ei,t3_fc67ei,74,"i love this question and i want to say it’s the exact question i asked myself over a year ago. after that i went really really deep into this topic, i read many books, articles and research papers on how learning works specifically about the science and research of it. if ever there was a question someone was fully qualified to answer it’s this one for me :)  ok so to break this down. the thing about athletics and cognitive fields is they don’t exactly compare in terms of the style of practice. while the same overall principles of deliberate practice do apply, it’s a bit more different when trying to learn a cognitive based field.  basically the programming (or any other subject) version of doing what mma fighters or other athletes do is this.   1) practice routine tasks until they become automatic  2) increasingly develop more and new ‘procedures’ to expand your programming ‘knowledge map’  so let me break this down.  1) repetitive practice is actually good to a degree when learning programming but only for any task that you don’t 100% feel comfortable and can do easily.   the way the brain works is that any information you need to think about is stored in your working memory, the issue is your working memory is very limited, it can only hold up to 4/5 pieces of information at once. however the brain gets around this by storing information in long term memory and if some information, concept, task etc if very robustly understood the brain can actually bypass the working memory and get it straight from long term memory.   this is why when driving at first when you’re learning it’s overwhelming but as an experienced driver you barely need to think about what you’re doing.  so practicing any tasks until it becomes automatic, second nature etc is an important part of mastery.  2) it’s one thing to automate routine tasks but in order to progress towards mastery you need to develop more, more knowledge more ways to do things. the way this is done is by developing what i call ‘procedures’. procedures are generalised steps for using concepts to do something. eg knowing how to filter an array or knowing how to test a certain component etc. these things are developed by working on any task where you don’t know the solution or trying to do new things that you aren’t fully clear on what it is or how to do it. you can also develop new procedures by reading other people’s code. but the key is, you need to **understand** it. understanding is the absolute key. it’s understanding with completeness, the five w’s, understanding from every angle.   the reason is that the way the brain works is knowledge is stored in long term memory like a map. it’s lots of knowledge connected to each other. signals actually travel through nodes in your brain to get to relevant knowledge so if those paths (connections) don’t exist your brain can’t travel that path and get to that new knowledge. for example, if you see an array, unless you understand that arrays have methods, that filter is one and that the business problem you are looking at requires filtering data as the solution, you won’t be able to solve it in this new way.  ok that was an incredibly brief summary of a load of the science on this topic. in summary to your original question, how do you practice:  1) repeatedly do routine tasks until you feel 100% comfortable and automatic doing them 2) solve problems you don’t automatically know the solution to, read other people’s code - all the while pushing to understand as much as you can of the new or unfamiliar solutions or code   if you want to know anymore please feel free to ask, this is like my life’s work and i have a tonne to share",blank

fjemdhq,fd0af3,t3_fd0af3,2,"yes.  most companies have a hard hr requirement on having a bachelor's degree in computer science as the minimum education requirement.  either that, or a bachelor's degree in a different major + tech bootcamp experience.  most traditional, medium-large companies have this as a strict requirement (so pretty much any jobs that actually pay 60k+ out of school).  i do see positions which list an ""associates in a technical discipline"" as their education requirement, but it's less common and usually implies a lower pay scale/less desirable job.  there is a *massive* difference between an associate's degree and a reputable 4 year program.  from what i've heard, my local associates degree mill is basically a joke, the classes are as easy or easier than high school.  comparatively, at university, we had projects which took entire weekends (48+ hours), only to barely pass the class in hard competition with our peers.  difficult classes were often curved with \~40% of the class failing.  the calculus and upper-level math classes alone were insane and required 3-4 hours of study a day, and honestly just a high iq to be able to pass.  many people tried their best but unfortunately realized they did not have the iq for the computer science degree and had to switch to an easier track.  those that graduated made an honest achievement that leaves no doubt as to their mental capability (iq) and hard technical skills.  that all being said, if i could go back and re-do my early career education, i would have just done a coding bootcamp instead and found one of those less desirable jobs, and just started saving and investing as soon as possible while building work experience.  i've noticed that although it was crazy difficult, school never really stuck with me or taught me practical/useful things, and i learn much better in a work environment.  again, that's just me and my experience though.  our curriculum was overly difficult without actually teaching useful things, thus leaving no time for self-study to actually learn the useful things.  i suspect many university programs are the same.",blank

fjg0cbq,fcwpy5,t3_fcwpy5,421,"i've been reading articles on what separates mid level devs from seniors. a lot of articles talk about how senior/principal level devs have a deep understanding of the business model/requirements/logic of the company and can essentially function as their own product manager.  however, in reality, what i find (at least in my current company) is that the cto and other high level execs expect this behavior from devs, but the actual pms actively discourage it. my pms encourage silo'd behavior and put blocks between developers and sales/consultants/support (the biz side of things).  as a result i see these symptoms exhibited by myself and my dev coworkers:  1. our understanding of the spec of any given project we're working on is usually incomplete. the pm doesn't have ""complete"" documentation of a project so there are lots of unknowns.   2. the devs have no idea *why* we're actually building something.   3. because of enforced silos, we don't do any dog-fooding. sales/consulting are the ones actually dealing with customer complaints and often know the nuances of the software spec better than the developers. devs have an underwhelming knowledge of what the end user actually wants (we also don't do any a/b testing or have any way to easily read customer feedback on our products).  op, do you have suggestions on how to improve the efficacy of an organization like this?",blank

[here's the list](/r/productmanagement/comments/avkqz6/a_list_of_100_pm_analytics_internships_search_tips/).   the advice i got while preparing was to get software engineering internships as a freshman and sophomore (unless i landed a big n pm internship) and a pm or closely related internship as a junior. following this advice worked out really well for me while recruiting for new grad pm roles.",blank
fjepvzt,fcwpy5,t1_fjdfn0h,421,"i would focus on getting a 'hands-on' internship (whether that is swe, design or data) or a ""general business"" internship (like bizops/strategy, finance, consulting etc)  for your first initial internships. then, try for one of the pm internships.  that said, people have done straight pm internships all the way through so depending on how much you hustle you could go straight into product without any detours.  once you have a pm internship though, the floodgates really do open. i don't think i've ever gotten rejected from any new grad/junior pm roles (except facebook, which is odd since i interviewed for swe the year before) at the screening stage just because i had that on my resume.",blank
fjf6s3x,fcwpy5,t1_fjdfn0h,421,"based on the pm new grads/interns i know, it's easier to switch from swe intern - pm than apply straight for one of the pm internships. of course, you should still apply!   my experience lays with microsoft. they have the explorer program for underclassmen where you do about 1 month pm work and 2 month swe work. lots of explorer interns i know applied for pm intern interviews and got changed to pm interns the next summer.   lots of swe interns also applied for pm full time positions and got them (my friends used the cracking the pm interview book). there's still lots of competition within the company for junior pm roles but it's a lot less compared to the amount of outside applicants.   also, as a swe intern in the company, you can network! everyone loves talking to interns and they're very helpful. you may also get to work with some pms in which case they already know you (yay!! and hopefully you're doing a good job so far so they have a good impression of you) and you can use that connection to tell them you're interested in switching to a pm role. even if you're a swe intern, you can still reach out to pms in the company and try to chat/learn with them.",blank
fje1xnx,fcwpy5,t1_fjdf9ww,421,"not op, but some of the commonly accepted big n pm interview faults are:  * not thinking big / only being able to think of incremental improvements * not being able to switch from detailed to high-level communication (you need to demonstrate ability to work with both devs and execs) * not asking clarifying questions / identifying goals * response structure. amazon wants a certain format (situation/behavior/impact), most places just organized, clear answers  most of my negative feedback (whether i recommend the candidate or not) is for the first issue.",blank
fjfhcyf,fcwpy5,t1_fjdxjwb,421,"in addition to the mixed pgm/""pdm"" naming issue at microsoft, microsoft has one of the highest product manager to engineering ratios in the industry. for some pms, that's why they have time to do the program work, for others they just have a very small scope and do a lot of scripting to get their own data. so even the ""product"" parts of the role at msft differ from the rest of the industry. and it's at the ""very political"" end of the spectrum.",blank

fjeaga5,fcwpy5,t1_fjdsmg0,421,"speaking as a product manager at a big-5 bank, a well rounded understanding on the entire software lifecycle is key. most pm’s come from the business world, but some of the best i’ve met started as software engineers, and therefore understand better the technical side of everything.  as a product manager i define the 5-year timeline for what software and features will be developed by our team. i work with marketing and sales to know what features are wanted and which will sell the best. i define all the screens that the software will have, and before i give them at to any graphics folks i first print a massive (often 9’ high, 30’ long) sheet of all the screens and the workflow of users. i then meet with each team (sales, marketing, support, qa, etc) and walk them through the user flow and get buy off from that team. i listen to their concerns and change as needed.   once all teams have signed off, i write the agile stories for the dev team and attend the daily stand-ups. i have to know every team and every type of user. i oversee (at a high level) everything and reduce roadblocks when possible.  i make sure qa is involved before a single line of code is written, to ensure everything is easily testable. i block off time at various testing facilities months in advance to ensure they’re ready for us. (we have a room full of bionic fingers and every type of smartphone to cross-platform test the app, but it books up far in advance.)  a great software engineer sees the trees and knows everything about them. a great product manager sees the forest and trusts their team to know about each individual tree",blank

fjflzkh,fd3zg7,t3_fd3zg7,166,"there is a number of factors that have gone into the indian presence in the industry.  the first reason is that indian parents see stem fields as the ticket to higher earnings and push their children in that direction. commerce and finance, medicine, engineering etc. are all well regarded for that reason. liberal arts and fine arts are not well regarded though that is starting to change just a little as employability in those fields improves.  second, the indian education system is geared towards the mechanics of test taking and everyone knows their success in life hinges on testing well which i use in the broad sense to also include interviews. indian students are trained to work long and hard to take tests and this habit serves them well during interviews.  third, there is high regard for education in indian culture. even parents of humble means try to scrimp and save to educate their children as much as possible. a lot of indian students travel to other countries for higher education. while they are more visible in the us, you would find them in countries from germany to china including in central asia.  finally, without the y2k outsourcing tsunami, there wouldn’t have been this number of indians in the us. outsourcing opened the gates for the academically second and third rung students to travel outside india. companies could claim they could hire equally qualified engineers for less without anybody actually measuring their ability. still, these people learned on the job and managed to thrive. nor did they remain limited to y2k outsourced jobs.  now, indians benefit from being a part of the global supply chain. just as it is difficult to manufacture something at scale and in a cost effective way without the supply lines in china, it has become difficult to do business in the it industry without indians  edit: one big factor nobody mentioned is that the indian education system uses english as the medium of instruction. so, indians speak english and generally adapt fast to the culture of english speaking countries.",blank

fjfqvg4,fc8sqb,t1_fj9cr8b,64,"i have a hard time believing that the tech stack listed on a job application has absolutely nothing to do with the job.  if we're talking about companies listing angular, react, and vue while only working in react, the assumption here is that a candidate with experience in either technology hold **transferable** skills that are suited for the position. another example: asking for experience in either of c/c++, c#, java, go, or rust, for a company that mainly uses rust.  so in this case, i still recommend applying for the job posting if you share **some** common ground with the job posting--however little. most students will have done a little something in web and back-end, so there isn't really a problem here.  what i wouldn't waste time on is applying for jobs that appear to be a disjunction from what your background entails. if i only had experience in web dev technologies, and had never seen a lick of c/c++ in my life, it probably doesn't make sense for me to apply to positions that call for a lot of c/c++ (and i wouldn't be interested in the position anyways if i was experienced in web dev).  i should have been specific to mention that companies will pick the most qualified position who applies, and that rarely does anyone perfectly match the requirements of the job. it should not discourage a candidate with **some** related experience to apply (the criteria for some=having a minimum one or two matching keywords). i might have been writing that reply late at night haha.  the only exception i can think of is if you hold amazing skills in one tech stack. then you should apply because companies like to hire really talented smart people.  so my advice to /u/kevinmcallizter still stands. i'll also improve it: go ahead and apply to internships if your resume matches one or two words with the list of qualifications. more is better. if you have time to kill, you can go ahead blindly applying to all jobs anyways, but only after you've been selectively targeting the jobs where your profile holds a strong position based on the qualifications listed.",blank

fjgwphy,fde691,t3_fde691,2,getting a ms is obviously doable but if you have no previous cs experience it will be brutal. if you're not motivated you will fail. keep in mind that some of your peers will have bs cs degrees which means they will already have 4 years of cs experience and know all the basics while you will have to spend time going over those by yourself.,blank

fjgjte5,fdcr3l,t3_fdcr3l,2,"i think that it's definitely possible to follow that path, i'm following a similar one.  similar because i'm still divided between following a freelancer path and finding work in foreign companies.  i'm actually studying every time i can, weekends/nights/work pauses, and working on some side projects (to sharpen my skills and to build a beautiful github profile)  i don't know about the odin project, i studied react/nextjs/node from udemy and started building projects. i think that is doing wonders!  (i'm a frontend developer at work, but we use [asp.net](https://asp.net) mvc)  meanwhile, i'm also taking english courses with a native speaker (i'm from italy too).  if both you and your girlfriend manage to work remotely, that would be really awesome!  wordpress could be a useful tool to build quick standard websites, it shouldn't take you long to learn it.",blank

fjc6si6,fcntjv,t3_fcntjv,8,"so i know you’re not going to like this answer but, find a new job. it’s been my experience, everywhere i go, that companies don’t like actually talking about coworker conflict, so it’s best to start looking elsewhere.  if a company is manifesting a culture where senior levels are toxic, that’s not a company you want to be in.  in the interim, make posts on reddit about them and turn their harassment into karma.",blank
fjc7afp,fcntjv,t3_fcntjv,8,"are they going out of their way to make you feel stupid?  or are they being concise and to the point, in order to get a never ending backlog of work done as quickly and correctly as possible.  i'm going to guess the answer would be different depending on who we ask.  for real though, there is a difference between being inappropriate and unprofessional, and just curt. it is sometimes difficult to not take curtness personally, but you have to remember at the end of the day you're both in a professional work place.  i'm not saying it's one way or the other, because you've given us very little to work with, but i just want to put the idea in your head that it's very very plausible your lead developer *means well*.  next time they say something that makes you feel stupid, or offends you, try bringing it up to them. communication is what makes teams work. good communication skills is what separates a good developer, from a great developer. express your concerns, but at the same time try to look at things from their perspective.  i once worked with a very abrasive architect. he was a borderline genius, lots of experience, but the way he talked to people was in a pretty condescending tone. that was just his personality (or lack there of). as soon as i learned to not take anything he said personally, things got a lot better. the thing is, despite him sometimes making it seem that it's silly i don't know about something, he was *always* willing to teach me once i manned up and said i didn't know something. in fact, he loved it. whenever he could get to preach about some topic he's an expert on, you could literally see the twinkle in his eye. anyways, i just learned to deal with him by not taking what he said personally. because he didn't *mean* anything personal by it. his intentions were good, he was just your basic communicationally-challenged architect with decades of experience.",blank

fjbyred,fcntjv,t3_fcntjv,8,"you must be working with [gilfoyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_d3d1rwbri). but seriously, try and first build a relationship that isn't just work. most people lighten up when you sometimes can talk about things that aren't related to the code. if still they are not budging, talk to your/their manager and explain your feelings. it is important to almost every company that you have a feeling of acceptance and inclusivity. if nobody listens to your gripes, start looking elsewhere. toxic work environments are not good for you or for them.",blank
fjc3xyb,fcntjv,t3_fcntjv,8,anybody else feel like this is a common trait in cs in general? maybe it's cause a bigger portion of this profession don't have the other parts of their lives as put together as their professional life.,blank
fjccc95,fcntjv,t3_fcntjv,8,"no, but do they treat all the junior devs this way?   and if you have a problem with the lead, the best way to deal with it is to approach them directly (1 on 1) about it.  if it doesn’t go well, they are either unreasonable or they just don’t like you... maybe you need to find a new job?",blank

fjdddo1,fcupes,t3_fcupes,4,"i am from the us and have 0 knowledge on how things work in korea. i am also assuming you don't have to worry about money while paying for college.   &#x200b;  i would go with the second option. especially if your college offers an accelerated bachelors to masters program. you'll have a higher level degree + minimum 3 years work experience (you haven't even counted internships yet!). i imagine companies in the us will see you like a really valuable candidate.     however, if you get enough internships and work experience throughout your bachelor's degree and do the military service you might be able to jump ship to the us quicker.   &#x200b;  regardless of your path aim for internships throughout your degree. i think that will give you the flexibility to make either decision when you are graduating from college.      i am woefully unqualified to answer the finer details of this question so weigh my advice less. i hope someone who has been in your shoes in the past can help out!",blank
