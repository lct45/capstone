my first pregnancy was awful and completely derailed my career at my previous job. how should i handle a second pregnancy at my new company?,ed67ci,blank,zenocrate,98,1576851572.0,"i used to work at amazon, and i was up for promotion when i got pregnant. i had a truly horrendous pregnancy — vomiting and nausea for months on end, exhaustion beyond anything i have felt in my life, the whole nine yards. i took a month unpaid to lie in bed and vomit in the first trimester, and was working at *maybe* 50% capacity for the remainder of my pregnancy.  it completely derailed my career track. not only was i not promoted, but i was hit with a performance improvement plan when i got back from maternity leave. it was clear that my org’s management simply didn’t believe me when i told them how incredibly sick and miserable i’d been. i blew the pip out of the water (because... you know... i wasn’t pregnant any more), but at that point i felt so frustrated that i quit and started a new job in april.  i *love* my new company, and i’ve done really well and have taken on a number of new responsibilities. however, my husband and i are trying to conceive a second, and i really don’t want the pregnancy to ruin this great thing i have going.  now that i know how awful pregnancy is for me, i’m thinking of requesting to be half time for the duration of the pregnancy (whenever it happens). we don’t have any part time employees, so i don’t know if they’ll accommodate the request. but i know from experience i won’t be able to deliver more than 50% of my usual output. i’d rather be up front about that from the get go, rather than be consistently underperforming for 9 months.  i know this is a little unorthodox, but is it a bad idea? are there any other ways to handle the situation?  edit: to be clear, this is not a conversation i plan to have now. i just want to figure out what i *should* say if and when i do get pregnant, whenever that is."
pregnancy first or changing career first?,eoym2c,blank,Fabiololo,16,1579098257.0,"in need of advice: i am a 35y/o female currently working full time and my bf and i are thinking of  having a baby. i am 35, almost 36, so can't wait for ever for that unfortunately.   at the same time, i finally found what i want to do (i have been thinking about a career reconversion for a long time now) and found the software system developer (ssd) program at bcit that starts september2020. i am doing the pre-req to get in the program at the moment.   i don't know if i should :  1-do the ssd program first and hopefully get a first job right away after (but first job is always hard to get as a junior dev) and if i am lucky enough, i could work remote after pregnancy.  2-just do the schooling and not worry about looking for the job if i get pregnant, but i don't feel it is good to leave a gap in between imo but maybe i am wrong about that (obviously i would keep practicing the coding and look for remote positions). i hear the market is pretty competitive when you first start into this field and i want to do things right.  3- or just don't bother with school yet and have a baby first and then later on change careers in a couple of years when the kid is in a daycare.  i am driving myself nuts with that and overthinking it.  thanks all for your kind advices!"

interning while pregnant,622ddy,blank,GirlLunarExplorer,35,1490765525.0,"hoo, here goes: i will be interning at a company in seattle over the summer.  i am also 12w4d pregnant, and will be 22 weeks when starting the internship and 34 at the end.  i'm already in the process of setting up obgyn appointments near where i will be working, trying to book early so that i get either early morning or lunch time appointments.  assuming all goes well, i will only ever need 4 doctors appointments before heading back down to my home obgyn where i will finish the rest of my pregnancy.  i also don't anticipate any special accommodations other than a chair (as opposed to a standing desk).  i haven't determined housing yet but if i get a roommate i was planning on informing them of my pregnancy but my question is whether i have a moral obligation to also tell my recruiter.  my fear, of course, is that if i tell them, they might rescind the offer or i will be automatically judged as being less productive even though i haven't started the internship yet.  i'm really tempted to just show up as is on the first day but don't know if this is ""appropriate.""  help?

interviewing while pregnant (in countries with maternity leave) / starting date in the far future?,5q1wuj,blank,LWdkw,14,1485357769.0,"i am currently in the process of interviewing with google europe. i am dutch and currently live in the netherlands. if they want me, there are about 6 cities in 6 different countries i could go (non of them in the netherlands).   between the first and second phone screen, i found out i am pregnant. this means that if i do end up getting the job, that would mean i'd work for a month or two (while being immobile, grumpy and forgetful), before going on paid (by the government) maternity leave for anywhere between 14 and 52 weeks, depending on which country i end up in. then i'd either be in a foreign country where i hardly know anyone yet or go back home for the duration of the leave and have to live with my parents with our brand new family.  my thinking is it's probably better for everyone if i'd just start after my (in that case dutch, 16 weeks) maternity leave is over. but that would mean a starting date in january 2018.   do you guys think that would be an option? i know us grads often have their offers months before they start, but how common are starting dates that are far away for non-grads, and outside the us?   normally i would recommend to just ask the recruiter, but it's still so early i don't really want to tell anyone yet, and tbh i don't want them to know before they either tell me they are going to make an offer or reject me. i do plan on telling them before actually signing.   tl:dr;   background: am pregnant, prefer to start after baby is born.   actual question: are big n/google generally okay with a start date quite far into the future?"
several month coding break?,715zo8,blank,GirlLunarExplorer,5,1505882721.0,"i tried looking for past questions about taking breaks but they all involved taking a break from their current job to work on interviews for their next one.  i'm looking for people's experiences when they took a break from coding itself, and how they got back into it.  i haven't coded since i got back from my internship 3 weeks ago, and i don't think i will be doing coding until i start my job.  here's the situation:  * i received a full time offer from a big n company to start work in february.   * i have one last semester (fall) to finish up my grad degree.  * neither of the two courses i'm taking involve any coding at all.    * i am also 37 weeks pregnant and i don't think i'd have the time to handle 2 classes + working on projects, taking online coding classes, etc., once the baby comes.  * i primarily use python, but know java and a bit of r, but i haven't used java in months, and r in over a year.  i was thinking of squeezing in a refresher course in r at least starting january (once school is done).  i am afraid that taking so long of a break from coding will make me forget everything i know, especially with a baby-addled momma brain.  has anyone, for any reason (travel, burn out), taken a break from coding for several months?  how did you ease yourself back into it?"
how to pass on a promotion?,6pqvda,blank,chyeahboiii,13,1501129699.0,"hi everyone!   a few weeks ago, closer to a month now, i was offered a promotion. my manager announced she was pregnant. they mentioned that they would need some additional help while she is out of the office. i met with my manager and the coo of the company. they literally just said that they would like to promote me to a new position they created. this would help to alleviate some of the duties my manager was in charge of going forward. so it wouldnt just be temporary. they let me know that they would get back to me and that was it. i have yet to receive an official offer.   since the initial meeting we've started some training. it is very sporadic and often cancelled. i also was recently filled in that i would be taking on most of my managers responsibilities on top of the already assigned work. after each training session, i have been told that the tasks we had gone over were now my responsibility. the training consists of her talking extremely fast through the task and then asking me if i have any questions. it isn't always bad but i'm often aksed if i have any questions and of things i can't possibly have questions about yet as i have not done that task before.  i was also asked to be on call for one saturday just to answer any questions an associate may have. i inquired about compensation for that and she let me know there would be none. i agreed to it since i figured it was one weekend. i later received an email thanking me for volunteering for one day and two afternoon's. okay, i can let that slide this time. my boss was going on vacation. it is still a small ish company and i like to be a team player. however, i get the feeling that i am being taken advantage of. something else to note is my manager is very temperamental. she will curse and yell if something goes wrong. she will also reprimand us in front of others in person or in group chats. she will often tell us to do things in way and then turn around and reprimand us for doing it that way. she will often ask if the training was not clear. i bite my tongue, apologize and correct my ""mistakes""   i was very excited about this promotion initially but i think i have made up my mind to pass on it seeing what the job really looks like. the final straw was when i came into work this morning. she was completely seething when i greeted her. she went in to explain that she could not find notes to an order and that we basically couldn't do anything right. i offered to help. she told me she didn't need any help. she calls me into her office later to reprimand me for something that wasn't my mistake. that's fine. i corrected it.   at this point i don't even care anymore as i have made up my mind to pass up on the promotion and maybe even start searching for another job. she expects us to complete our work load on time everyday and on time. this used to be a three person workload but they cut us down to two people. i don't complain to managers about this ever. but i will mention if it is busy in passing. i work very hard, stay late, come in early, cover days and help where i can. i would love to get overtime but it is strictly forbidden. we can only keep up with so much! there is no sympathy to be had anyways so why bothering complaining. my guess is that they would have offered me salary anyways and expected me to stay and get the work done.   since i've take on my new tasks, i have been making more mistakes. i'm being stretched too thin and this is only the beginning! i'm grateful that they thought of me but no amount of pay that they will offer is worth this trouble. i feel so guilty for not having come to this conclusion sooner. with her due date nearing, i know i have to act fast.   i really loved my job up until recently. i love the people i work with and i love my hours. i've learned to deal with my manager for the most part. if anything the pregnancy has helped her stop treating me so awfully. i used to dream about these kind of opportunities and now i'm breaking out into hives from the stress. my plan is to tell them on friday so that way she will have some time to cool off and hopefully not bite my head off. i suspect they will try to talk me into going through with it.   i'm worried that after i let them know, they will cut my hours and change my schedule. my question to you is, what is the best way to pass on this promotion? how can i minimize fall out? i don't want to leave the company and think that they might read into this like i am. i am going to cover my ass and start looking regardless. i hope it doesn't come to that though.  tldr: i was offered a promotion with the official offer still pending. my boss has a temper and i would like to pass on the promotion. how do i go about that wiithout losing my job?"
"women who've been pregnant, when did you tell your boss/pm, and why?",3ogr1p,blank,VividLotus,14,1444694492.0,"title pretty much says it all. i'm interested in hearing from women who work in technical roles, especially at software or hardware companies, and who live in the u.s. i'd also of course be interested in hearing from men who've taken or plan to take a substantial amount of paternity leave due to being the primary caretaker for a child, or some other reason.   this is a question that comes up a ton in women's and pregnancy-specific subreddits/forums, but i feel like women in actual technical roles at tech companies are in kind of a unique position. most of us probably work primarily or even exclusively with men, so it's not like we've got people around us taking leave left and right (even if your company offers paternity leave too, a boss is likely going to have a different attitude or concern about a man asking for a week or two off than a woman asking for an actual maternity leave). but at the same time, a large percentage of us can probably work right up until the time of delivery, and so we're not in the situation of women in male-dominated blue collar industries or even other stem jobs that involve things like dangerous chemicals or physical labor."
would you participate in a class action over disabilities induced by open-plan offices in tech companies?,5nhhtp,blank,tertian_rain,8,1484226622.0,"it's well known that technology companies love open-plan offices because they're cheaper than other alternatives, and because they give management visibility of their workers at all times. but the constant noise, the cramped quarters, and the anxiety caused by needless interruption and visibility from behind have made a lot of people sick. i've been in tech for a long time and i'd guess that at least 20 percent of tech attrition is due to open-plan offices (and the project management bullshit, but one issue at a time).   bay area therapists see a lot of ""open-plan syndrome"" but the truth is that *open-plan syndrome* doesn't exist as a separate diagnosis. that is, if you develop panic attacks in an open-plan environment, you now have panic disorder and you might have it for the rest of your life. i'm sure there are plenty for whom this is the case.   an argument can be made that open-plan offices are uniquely stressful for programmers, who formerly only had to dedicate mental energy to being productive, but must now split attention between being and appearing productive. this mental strain seems to cause a lot of people to break.   it'd be ideal to find people who've developed their disabilities in open-plan offices, since it makes the strongest case. (i don't qualify. although open-plan offices made my condition far worse, my first episodes were in my teens.) as a matter of statistical certainty, i'm sure that such people out there. ideally, we'd have people who can testify that they developed disabilities *because of* open-plan offices and who have the documentation to back it up.   additionally, an argument could be made that open-plan offices are discriminatory. they force people with health problems (including anxiety disorders and pregnancy) to have them *in public*, causing what might otherwise be mild medical issues to be professional catastrophes. i'm sure the ageism is a major part of this industry's open-plan fetishism and because people have a tendency to say stupid things in emails, i'm sure that it could be proven in discovery.   the potential value to society is huge. a victory would change the tone of the valley completely. it may not fix the place up, but it's a step in the right direction. we could start a dialogue around programmers' work conditions and create environments founded on basic human decency, in which we're trusted as professionals rather than watched, poked and prodded until people crack. this would have the potential, unlike the million dopey web startups out there, to actually change the world.   is there anyone here who would participate? and are there attorneys who would be interested in taking the case to the courts?"

homeless to 75k to being asked if i'm cognitively impaired [wot],e8zxbp,blank,trashlid001,51,1576055518.0,"hi cscq,  &#x200b;  i wanted to write this out to clear my head before i start applying and moving forward.  &#x200b;  i received my bachelor's of cs in december of 2018 with a sub 3 gpa from a low-/mid-tier state school. prior to this i had estranged myself from my family entirely. i was jobless and listless. funny enough couch surfing, though it wreaked havoc on other aspects of my life, turned out a positive for my mood and in the last few semesters of my undergraduate i became very motivated to succeed.  &#x200b;  it took \~6 months and \~250 applications to get offered a position. i had plenty of interviews and got decently good at talking. i focused on c++, python, computer graphics, linear algebra, i did some leetcode (my interviews generally weren't super heavy on these...), etc. etc. it was an iterative process. i'd fail an interview, think on what went wrong, try to decide whether that was specific to the company or something more general, then bolster myself in that area. at times it felt like i was thrashing in what topics to study. you have to make sure to check whether something is worth it or not, and whether it's actually pertinent enough for you to remember and carry forward. i had to also remind myself that generally i was indeed moving up. this went on for 6 months but i was running out of time. i got a position at an amazon warehouse on the night shift and it paid well. then, as if miraculously, i got a callback with an offer for 75k.  &#x200b;  the interview that ""stuck"" was fairly straightforward. some basic graphics concepts, some c++, a take home program with a solution that amounted to a few lines of linear algebra in c++ (my work had paid off! thank you strang and 3blue1brown!). there was also a second interview of 5 rounds of 30 minutes each with different company employees. this was for a junior position for rendering engineer. things moved very quickly and i was expected to join within 2 weeks. before flying 2000 miles across the united states, i reconnected with my family and had a sit-down. it went smoothly all things considered.  &#x200b;  a few things...  there was no on-boarding.  within 2 months i'm asked to add to the product. not to go into details but this is a physically based rendering engine and i was asked to implement a phase function for it. the context i was given this task was incredibly vague and amounted to ""this research paper mentions this... whatever it is, so... add it."" i'm in over my head but i did it.  i recently spent 6 weeks debugging a software render engine, implementing an a-buffer with software fragment generation, sending it through existing pipelines to cuda kernels to be operated on alongside other data. i was so excited when the image finally came out right but i was told that i took too long to complete this task.  my lead is, and this is not hyperbole, literally one of the worst communicators i have ever known in my life. if god himself were to command me, under penalty of perdition, to truthfully write my life's top 10 bad communicators, this lead would be on that list.  so i'm in my 6th month and i've never once felt secure in my position here. that's normal, imposter syndrome, i'm familiar with the term. little devils on your back. you feel you're cheating the company. you shouldn't get paid this much to do this little. all this time you secretly should've been aborted. your incompetence reeks and everyone can smell it. you stepped in incompetence and everyone can smell it. etc. etc. it's great to know that so many other people go through it and that, generally, these feelings are unfounded. it really sucks when these feelings are validated by your superior.  1) he has insinuated multiple times that i cheated on my interview (i did not)  2) he brought me into a conference room and talked down to me for 30 minutes (""\*sigh\*okay(with his head in his hand)... let's go over this one more time..."") ending with ""you should work 45 hours until your productivity increases.""  3) today i asked a question and he walked me to a conference room like an angry dad and asked me if i was cognitively impaired, then he told me to describe insert sort (completely unrelated). he then asked if i was depressed.  4) there are smaller passive-aggressive-type things that i pick up on but aren't worth detailing.  &#x200b;  so here i am. ready to start the grind all over again.  &#x200b;  advice? concerns? comments? please feel free to share, i'll be up all night."

what should i do,c90dv5,blank,theLordfrenzy,5,1562259871.0,"hey everyone, i just graduated from high school and am going to start university this fall. earlier this year i decided to start working and learn angular, and am part way through a project im making. im going to the university of waterloo here in the greater toronto area in canada, and i have 6 mandatory coop terms. i was looking at requirements for some internships in the area (front end and full stack) and they all require some react experience, with very little using angular. i was wondering if i should abort angular and start diving into react this valuable summer so i can maximize my chances at a solid internship (non qa stuff) next summer, or should i continue finishing a project in angular (expecting to be finished by end if july) and then go for react. if i abort angular and work with react, i will be able to get to full stack with sql, react native, and mern stack sooner, but will leave learning a framework and making app i have invested a long time in unfinished, and wont have that solud angular experience (i really like the framework, even tho its complicated) i was considering doing mean stack or a .net backend for angular, but there isnt too much of a market for people with those kinds of skills where i live. what should i do in my situation, stick to angular and do react afterwards (or angular full stack), abort angular and start react asap, or try to do a full stack react udemy course and try to learn react with full stack in order to save time. i really have to use this summer wisely,  because idk if ill be able to learn this stuff on the side as ive never experienced university and how intense it may be, so i dont want to risk it. thanks!"

need advice on an issue with a take home coding challenge.,9jhs0p,blank,wingren013,0,1538119103.0,"so i recently did a phone interview with a company and they gave me a take home coding test. it was fairly easy and i submitted it. today i got an email from them saying that they had to change something to compile it on their systems and that they were getting an error and they would like me to change my code to resubmit it. they sent me the error message and the exaact thing they changed. so i changed the code (it was a minor two line change having to do with os specific system calls) and ran it. to my surprise it worked completely fine.  so i checked the error message they sent me, and thanks to writing good error messages immediatly pinpointed the part of the code that was failing. it was my first call to malloc() , allocating 100 bytes of memory. under that i had a check to see if the pointer returned by malloc() was null and abort the prgram if it was. it seems that on their end malloc was failing to allocate 100 bytes.  the only reasonable explainations for this i can think of is that they are running on an oddly set up virtual machine or that this is part of the test and they want to see if i know why this might fail. i'm honestly perplexed at what to do. i could change my code so that i don't use any dynamic memory allocation. but since its a c program and the particular problem was testing my knowledge of data structures that seems like it would be an automatic failure.  any advice?  p.s. because this is this internet and somebody will say this say something along these lines of the company just being incompetent: the company is large enough that it is very likely not a matter of incompetence on their end."
am i being taken advantage of or am i doing a bad job?,6uawv6,blank,Elaphoil,2,1503014272.0,"hi. i'm in a bad spot in my career and i need some advice and i need some perspective from people who have been in this industry for a while.  a couple years ago i got my first job right out of college. the company provided training for me in the language i was going to be working in(cobol) and i relocated once the training was complete.  the start of the job was a bit of a shit show. my boss had a heart attack almost immediately after i came down to the nh office. for weeks i had minimal direction, and i was begging for work. eventually i got started on some kind of minor projects, working with business consumers and analysts. i did alright, by then i took on the project that has come to define my time at this job. i was tasked with rewriting one of our core programs that prepared files for downstream consumption. this program was very important to the company, as the interest calculations it provided were responsible for about 10% of total revenue.   up until this time i was receiving satisfactory performance reports. i even received a small amount of stock, that is about to mature in a month or two at the time of this writing. then i started this project and i basically had about of year of bad performances, missed milestones, and spiraling depression and anxiety. this culminated in me missing a week of work. since then the project has completed and i've received a mid year review, giving me an inconsistant, which i felt was appropriate, considering how much i struggled with this project.  i hated this project so much. it is the second most complex program in the company, and i was chosen for a rewrite, in part to educate me in this fucking 60 year old nightmare. the last time this project was attempted it was aborted. the last couple project si was working on we're nowhere near this complicated or vast. i had no idea how to handle it and i had no idea how to tell my colleagues, because i inherited a schedule from the person who completed the first phase of the project.  on top of this, i am technically an hourly employee. i have been tapped for on call support for the past year or so and i don't know if they should have been paying me for this. i would work 8am - 10pm monday thru sunday in a weekly rotation.  i dunno. i'm not sure if this me being a bad employee or if i'm not being treated correctly. please give me some understanding if this is considered appropriate or not. thank you in advance for your feedback."
going to cs program this coming spring. this will be my 2nd degree - any tips?,3qpwbb,blank,sethosayher,5,1446163734.0,"i graduated in 2011 as a political science major at boston college. despite graduating with honors, work was hard to come by. after years of temping and abortive attempts to go to grad school (thought about a poli sci phd but the state of academia today is dispiriting) i found a decent job in property tax law a year and a half ago. i learned a great deal about corporate life but i realized i wasn't very interested in the problems posed to me by my field of work (which really weren't very intellectually stimulating, at least at my level). i've always enjoyed working with computers and slowly introduced myself to python. i returned to unix/linux and came to love the command line. i considered autodidactism as a path to learning programming, but to be honest i love the structure and demands of a curriculum, so i've opted to apply to local cs programs here in ny. i found a cheap program in manhattan with cuny, and i hope to graduate with my second bachelor's in two to three years.  i wanted to get some advice from you guys as to how i should approach my cs studies. the chief advantage of where i'll be studying is my being in manhattan, which obviously has a massive tech scene. i know that the biggest differentiator between myself and others cs grads will be any projects i work on, as well as interning and co-op experience. i'm also apprehensive of the circuitous path i've taken to cs, especially as this will be my second degree. any tips, advice or insight?"
common falsehoods about big tech,eqkbp1,blank,Hungry_Radio,554,1579401549.0,"like a lot of you i spend a good amount of time on tech career related sites like this one or hacker news. i’ve noticed that whenever the topic of big prestigious tech companies comes up, there are often a lot of people making strong negative statements that goes against my own experience and that of my friends and coworkers. while there are many good reasons not to work for one of these companies, i do think they present a rare opportunity to advance ones career and financials in today’s market (and who knows how long that will last) so i’d hate to see people self select out based on something that isn’t true.   to be clear, i’m not saying that these things never happen, just that they aren’t the norm from what i have seen. my personal experience is about 4 years of big tech work, across 3 teams, 2 companies (and a couple of years at a mid sized company and a start-up before then).   **big tech companies have terrible work life balance**  from an organizational standpoint all of the big tech companies promote a healthy work life balance. obviously that doesn’t mean that it actually gets implemented, but in my experience the majority of people work something like 30-45 hours per week.  the people who work longer hours than that tends to be due to the following reasons: * people who are trying to get on a fast track for promotion. these companies are full of ambitious people so this is relatively common * teams that have a bad (often inexperienced) manager. i haven’t seen this personally, but i’ve heard stories * people who are struggling and believe working longer hours will get them out of the hole. this does not tend to be a good tactic to stop being a low performer  ambitious people are somewhat common but overall, people really don’t put in crazy hours, and since people tend to come in and leave at very different hours no-one really knows how long you spend in the office anyway. i’ve never heard of a manager questioning how long someone spends in the office  **unlimited pto means no pto**  unlimited pto comes with a few benefits to the employer: * they don’t have to pay out accrued vacation when someone leaves * they don’t have to track time off as diligently * many employees self select into not taking a lot of vacation  for employees it has a couple of benefits: * you don’t have to be as “tactical” with your pto, you want time off, you take it. there’s also no incentive to save it so you may as well take it * if you’re a senior person and/or a high performer it’s an easy “unofficial” perk you can take advantage of. i see people who are doing well taking 8+ weeks of time off and no-one batting an eye  for regular employees you should just consider it about the same amount of vacation as you would get at another company (3-4 weeks). no-one is going to care if you take that much unless your team is deeply dysfunctional. to reiterate my initial caveat, i’m not claiming unlimited pto is better, i’m just saying for most people it’s about the same as the vacation you'd get elsewhere.   **the interview process is beyond broken**  there are many issues with the standard tech interview process but lately the counter movement has been particularly rabid. in a normal interview loop you will not be asked to implement a red-black tree. you might be asked how you would find the k largest elements in a list. you will not be expected to silently have written out the optimal solution without any syntax issues within 5 minutes. you will be expected to be able to quickly sketch out a naive solution and start discussing how it can be improved.   but the most important point: these interviews are not the only type of interview in a normal loop, and they’re really only the *most* important when you have no other experience. i’ve had several loops personally where this style of coding question were fewer than half of the interviews, and as you get more senior it only goes down further.   **in the bay area you're living paycheck to paycheck unless you're making millions**  this one is especially prevalent and seems to come from people who’ve spent 5 minutes on redfin and called it a day. to exemplify using people most readers here have interacted with (or still do for the students reading): there are currently thousands of grad students in the bay area. a large portion of these students are living off a $30k stipend as their only source of income. their lives are definitely not kush, but they make do, lead enjoyable lives, have hobbies, travel, eat out etc etc. i’ve done this personally. now, if they all can make do on $30k, anyone on a “measly” tech salary of $100k here really shouldn’t have a problem. yes, if you have a family the equation change, and you can always come with a set of requirements that price you out (and that’s totally fine, knowing what you want from life is powerful) but this general accepted wisdom that a single person making $100k would be “struggling” here is pretty out of touch.   **in summary**  these jobs are not perfect, and your day to day won’t be heaven on earth. but they are pretty good, better than most other corporate jobs in my experience, and the pay and benefits are truly outstanding so make sure the reason you don't pursue them matches reality."
i'm [f31] not interested in women's networking groups--will this hurt my career?,e8d1lu,blank,missmagdalene,31,1575941494.0,"i graduated from college 5 years ago with a cs degree and had interned with this company 2 years before graduation and had a full-time position offer on completion of my school. i love this job, i love the work that i have as well as my immediate coworkers and other peers.  this is a large company with multiple sites. i am employed with them in the midwest and we are a smaller site with 350-400 employees maybe 1% at our location are women. i know most of them by name but in my particular dev/engineer position, i do not work with more than one (she is project management) on a daily basis. there are other female devs at our site, but they are working on a different product than i am or are in other areas of management.  first, i want to say that i am praised in my work and in my 5 years here i have been promoted twice for my work and merit including my first patent. my local team are all male and we all work very well together. i have never felt discriminated against or left out by my peers or my management.  however, i am frustrated today because a topic keeps coming up in my one-on-ones with my manager which is progressively bothering me. **my manager appears to be judging me for not attending a local chapter of our more company-wide women's networking events**. i have told him that they do not interest me at this time, but every one-on-one that we have that happens to be soon after an event (that i had declined) i feel almost like i get a lecture on how it would be useful for my career to network with other women, or to consider attending the events to just do more networking in general. i don't disagree with his last point, but if the topics don't interest me in the first place or i feel have no relevance to me, why does this have to keep getting brought up in our discussions?  i attended one once when they were trying to get things rolling 3 years ago or so, but i did not find the conversations useful or interesting and none of the topics they chose for future meetings really sparked my interest or seemed of any relevance to me in my current position or the career path that i want to continue on. therefore i have usually declined the invites to these events. i do read what they will be doing and discussing, but they have again yet to feel relevant to me.  i guess my question is this, **am i really hurting my career by not attending these networking events?** there are women in management that attend these and they have had female executives as guest speakers come maybe once a year since they've begun. however, the maximum attendace i've seen (at least according to the calendar invites) are maybe 12-15 women. i do not want to switch my career to management, or at least not this early in my professional career. **how do i handle this? should i suck it up and go to a few events to get him to stop bringing it up? i have stated to him before the reasons that i haven't gone to them but they do not seem enough as it keeps getting brought up. i'm concerned that it is effecting my managers perception of my ambition in this career.**  i'm also worried that i am coming across as sexist towards my own gender. if there were additional networking event opportunities with topics that interested me, i would certainly make an effort to go--regardless of which networking group puts it on. this womens group has also very openly encouraged the men in our company to attend these as well. they are appropriately inclusive and open the invitiation to everyone in the company, but that being said i have not heard that a lot of men that have gone to these events."
is the industry this bad for black women?,cqowtu,blank,Heimeimiao,439,1565899527.0,"so i just finished an internship and frankly, it was the worse experience of my life. i would have rather worked in fast food and the only saving grace was the pay.  i'll start by prefacing that i'm a black woman and a senior in cs at a top school (and probably top 5 cs school, i'm not sure of the rankings). although i'm admittedly average at leetcode, i have a good portfolio and past (relevant) work experience.  here's a highlight of everything that happened:  - from the beginning, i was offered very little guidance on our codebase, technology, etc. so getting everything set up was a disaster since i was on my own with understanding how everything worked. and oftentimes when i'd message someone, i'd get ignored or i'd get a non-answer. in-person help only happened when i started constantly annoying multiple people with questions. it always seemed like no one really wanted to help me, though.  - the company is decently-sized and based in sv, and they have ""diversity initiatives"", but they're laughably bad and i'm almost certain now that i was the only black female developer in the entire company and one of maybe 10 underrepresented minority women (but it's not like there were too many other people outside of white men actually).  - it was immediately clear during meetings that they really didn't have a place for me on the team because they had to find stuff for me to do, but the other intern on my team never had this problem. most of my tasks were not programming heavy or required much thought, but they were large tasks that were very monotonous.  - the engineers on my team and other teams would talk poorly of one of their interns when i was there. they openly trashed his abilities and throughout the entire program, gave him simple tasks and justified it by saying that he couldn't program. he was an underrepresented minority and regardless of his skills, it was inappropriate to gossip about other interns when i was present.  - we had a majority black (male) department actually, and they're pretty vital to the devs, and the devs love to talk down to and openly insult them. perhaps it's a superiority complex thing, but it really rubbed me the wrong way, so i went out of my way to be extra nice to them (and they were super friendly).  - even after i told other devs what team i was on, i'd still get asked my major. my team is the backbone of the company and requires the most cs knowledge, yet no other intern was asked their major (we had a luncheon so that's how i know). it felt like the devs had to confirm that i was actually a cs major even though everyone on my team was.  - the women devs were the nicest ones there and actually treated me like a human; most of the men were either super standoffish or ignored me when i spoke to them. there were a few men that were super nice and welcoming.  - if a person asked me a question, some devs would butt in and answer it when the question wasn't for them. this happened a lot.  - i had small 3-4 person meetings about something i'd been working on and even if someone was speaking, they never looked at me or addressed me directly.  - questionable content in company group chats   - some devs made backhanded comments about me not knowing different tools (like git, command line, etc.)  - i was talked down to and infantilized by team members.  - they had a super high turnover rate, and it's from people quitting.  i did eventually break and have a few crying sessions in the bathroom because i hated working there and if it wasn't for the pay, i would have quit a month before my last day. i know now i need to be more assertive and vocal but these were known problems that have been discussed in internal company forums. and it really makes me disillusioned with the entire industry because if i'm going to be treated like crap regardless, why bother?  edit: i just want to add that i'm coming to this conclusion because the other intern *isn't* treated this way. besides the other black intern on a different team, the one on my team is treated exceptionally well and if i were treated like him, this would be a good internship experience. obviously there's company culture issues but not everyone is treated this badly, which is why this bothered me. if everyone was treated like shit, then it's whatever, but when you have people getting treated better than others, for no apparently obvious reason, that's a cause for concern. i did mention a number of times where the other interns weren't treated like i was.  edit 2: i know git and the command line. i also use tmux and vim. i also addressed this point in a few comments in this thread."

"how to deal with a male coworker who is trying to be ""woke""?",e8h6dq,blank,derobderobderob,482,1575959331.0,"i graduated last year and have been working at my job for about a year and a half now. i have been the only woman on my team the whole time. at first i was the only woman in a team of 5. (i'm also the youngest at 25 but that's pretty much irrelevant).   untill recently it all felt great, i felt like i was just being seen as a fellow developer and not ""the girl"". i was treated with respect and such. a few months ago as part of a reorg my team merged with another team, so now i'm the only woman in a group if 16. and then things felt different.  i still feel like i'm respected, but now i am acutely aware that i am ""the girl"" on the team. this was almost exclusively caused by one of my coworkers.  one of the first times i was in a meeting with him, he started going over the top when trying to seem inclusive. like drawing long hair on a stick figure, correcting everyone who used ""he"" generically for a user with ""or she!"", etc.   one day he came to ask my coworker who sits back to back with me a question. then he says ""(my name), you may be a minority on this team, but you are still a valued member and your thoughts are important.""  just the other day we were working on a project together and he came over to my desk to talk about it. we were on the topic of dismantling an old system in favor of the new one, and he said ""we also need to dismantle the patriarchy!"" and internally i was like why is this necessary to be said right now?  and the final thing that bugs me is he treats the rest of our team members the same, direct and emotionless. but with me he talks all soft and gentle and skirts around issues. i feel like he is treating me like some sort of fragile flower and it bugs me so much.  all of this has also opened another can of worms for me where now i feel very sensitive to perceived slights because i often see them through the lens of ""they see me as just the girl"". like my desk being moved farthest from the rest of the team and facing away from everyone else. or another coworker constantly fielding questions about code i wrote and know 100% about, just because he has a version he slightly modified that is used more. then i end up often wondering if i was just the ""equal opportunity hire"" if you will, even though i completely know i have the skills and experience. it's all inconsequential and not purposefully done but now i second guess stuff. constantly being reminded of my status as ""the girl"" on the team is very demoralizing.  i'm sure he has good intentions and is just trying to make sure i am comfortable and don't feel like an outsider, but i feel more like an outsider now because of his constant virtue signaling.   i'd like to tell him to tone it down because it makes me uncomfortable, and that i know he has good intentions, but i don't know a professional way to do so. like do i email? slack? set up a meeting? does anyone have any advice for how to talk to him about this?  edit: clarification  edit 12/11: thanks everyone for the advice! i am waiting for another ""incident"" to talk to him about it so it is more relevant and he might remember it. i'll keep everyone posted"

potential career options for a software engineer who has been pushed into technical support?,ebqwht,blank,stilln0tbitten,29,1576585916.0,"i'm a 24f with a 2.5 year career as a full time software engineer. i graduated in 2017 with a bs in cs and managed to snag a pretty cool gig as a software engineer at a big tech company. i got really exhausted by the lack of work life balance and depressed by how boring the busy work i was given was. i ended up changing jobs after a year and have been with my current company for just over a year. while i maintain the title of software engineer, i am nothing but glorified technical support of a software package. i get emails from customers who will take up several hours of my day to ask me questions that could be answered by reading the documentation we provide. my team is falling apart after lay offs/departures and no one is picking up the slack so i'm doing several roles (project management, product management, tech support, business analysis etc.). i don't program at all anymore. i found out after being hired that we hire 3rd parties to code most of our work. if anything, i maybe have to fix a bug every few weeks, but even those are few and far between. at the beginning i lived for this and loved being able to leave work at work and not program useless app features on the daily, but now i feel like i may as well have a degree in communications and business. so i guess i am stuck. i hated programming useless stuff all day every day and suffering through soul crushing deadlines, but now i hate not programming and dealing with non technical folk and the lack of structure. i find no meaning in anything i am doing and it's harder and harder for me to go into work anymore.   what kind of positions can offer me a chance to do meaningful work as a computer scientist and minimize the burnout? not necessarily software engineering and definitely no more tech support. i've always had an interest in cs education (teaching). my software engineering background is mostly android development by the way. i thought about going back to school into a graduate or phd program, but i have ~$25,000 of school debt that i would like to pay off first (and i also never want to go into debt again). any advice for how to proceed-- maybe suggestions for what i could try looking into?"

autism discrimination,ehbk84,blank,buffcuff,24,1577682547.0,"despite the webdev/programming archetype being the introvert nerd, i have personally found that as someone with high functioning autism and who firmly fits that introvert image, that there is a huge amount discrimination against people with autism.  perhaps i have been unlucky with the organisations i have been employed at, the last 2 being multi-billion dollar corporations. my experience has been that the team would quickly recognise my differences (introversion, lack of eye contact etc) and start gossiping behind my back which would then lead to bullying. at my last 2 organisations colleagues would subtly be unhelpful and make life difficult for me....basically wanting me to fail. the stress and hurt from the bullying forced me to resign.  i should point out that i consider myself a competent developer and relatively strong with problem solving. i’m the type who actually enjoys algorithm challenges and actively participate in open source and learning new technologies. i code relatively well....at my last organisations i and other devs would say i was the strongest in my teams.  and yet none of this mattered...perhaps it even was a negative as it made other developers, including more supposedly senior developers look lacking.  at this point i just feel incredibly demotivated....the whole corporate beuracracy bullshit is enough to make any introvert lose hope. case in point is my last manager, unusually a female tech lead, but who was incompetent at the tech aspect but very competent at the social aspect and knowing who to befriend to move up the greasy ladder and how to avoid accountability. infuriatingly and ironically she was keen to be seen as an anti-discrimination advocate in tech....but her cause was women in tech.  honestly i feel the social element in programming work is overstated and most jobs can be done fully remotely....if i was a small business owner overseeing work i wouldn’t tolerate the bullshit people easily get away with at large organisations. my last company was full of so many bullshit business/agile people who i feel have much less value than the developer, yet got equivalent remuneration and played a key part in my resignations.  my question: what is the best path for me."

i feel like a diversity quota hire for my internship,dav5ca,blank,klarrynet,95,1569792717.0,"i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but i haven't been able to get it off of my mind ever since i got my intern offer. if there are any minorities who've gone through these feelings, i'd love to hear how you dealt with them.  a few weeks ago, a faang recruiter reached out to me for my resume, and then got me signed up for an on-campus interview. i figured that they got my contact information from my applications from the past two years, and assumed that the reason they reached out first was because i was a woman. my suspicion was confirmed when i saw that 90% of the people at the day 1 interview were women.  the whiteboard questions were fairly straightforward, and i'm honestly really proud of how i did on the second day interview (you had to pass day 1 to get to day 2). i illustrated my thought process out very well, and my interviewer had to ask almost no leading questions for me to get to the optimal solution. that being said, i feel like the questions were almost.....a bit easy for a faang interview, not to mention that there were only two interviews total (i got asked about four questions).  obviously, i'm delighted that i got the offer, and i do think i'm a very capable programmer who'll do fine there. still, i don't feel that i've deserved it at all, knowing that this interview was literally set up as a diversity initiative, and that the interviews i had might have been slightly easier (and shorter) than what normal people might have had to go through.  what's worse is my attitude about it with the people who found out. everybody has been really happy for me (both the men and women) saying i deserve it, but i keep shoving it off as ""i did do well on the interview but honestly i wouldn't have any sort of offer if i weren't a girl"".....which is really doing a disservice to all of the women engineers out there. this isn't the first time i've pushed off something as ""it's because i'm a woman lol"" (namely my internship from last summer), but this time, i really can't be proud because i know that i got an interview soley because i'm a woman.  i guess i might be acting spoiled about the whole situation, and should just accept my lucky situation instead of complaining about ""but did i deserve it???"" since at the end of the day, it doesn't change the situation much. still, if there's any advice anybody has as to how to process these feelings, i'm all ears.     edit: thanks for all of the supportive comments! i think a few contributing factors were probably that a week before, i had a couple of technical challenges that were much more difficult than what i was expecting, and i just barely passed one of them (got rejected right away by the other). because of that, i assumed ""ah, all big tech companies must give interview questions that are this hard"", not realizing that sometimes, you end up a bit lucky without an intentional ""we're giving this job to you because you're a minority"".      in addition (and this is probably the biggest factor that i didn't realize at all), a lot of the cs kids at my college do this very annoying thing where they judge your worth as a person with wherever you're interning. a lot of them assume every person who gets hired at a big-n is either a genius or had connections, and that nothing could possibly be wrong with your life if you have a good sf internship. i hate having expectations on me, and i don't want people to have an inflated impression of me because of a lucky opportunity i happened to get (this is a reaction a friend of mine already had). i've begun to realize that i should just ignore all of that bullshit, and enjoy myself without worrying about what these people think."

equality in our field discussion,cos9ky,blank,oops_1,82,1565525446.0,"is it wrong that colleges and companies are giving exclusive opportunities only to women in computer science?   there are many majors that have similar gender gaps with the majority being female yet there are no exclusive opportunities to encourage men into those fields. i've experienced many exclusive events, presentations and internships being provided solely for women and it just doesn't feel right to me. i haven't seen anyone (male or female) being hazed or discouraged by their peers. from what i've experienced,  everyone is very helpful in my college. we want everyone to succeed no matter gender, race, etc. i have asked this question to my peers and enjoyed listening to their perspectives which is why i posted it here.   my point of view to start: i personally feel that having exclusive opportunities to women belittles them as if saying they need the extra help to succeed in this field. it is creating a divide instead of bringing us together on the one thing we all (male and female) share, our passion for computer science and desire to see each other graduate and become successful. the solution to decreasing the gender gap in computer science shouldn't be done by excluding males simply because there are too many.  i'd like to know what's everyone's perspective and thank you for taking the time to share.    also, i'm happy to see so many people love what they do in the computer science field that it really makes me excited to be graduating soon. i also want to thank those who have shared their problems in the field. i have learned so much from the comments on how to tackle various issues and hope that everything turns out well for those who have had it rough.  edit to add table from department of education on the enrollment of men and women in each field of study.

some coworkers resent me for being invited to a conference they wanted to attend because i’m a woman who came from a coding bootcamp?,bfeyfq,blank,throwawaygirl388,35,1555811328.0,edit: taking this down because i’m scared someone on my 16 person team will see.   thanks for the advice. i learned:  - i should not be ashamed for coming from a coding bootcamp and let them make me feel inferior because i don’t have a “traditional cs degree” or for being 27 and not having the 5+ years of experience the other guy my age on the team has   - i am going to work harder at learning backend engineering. all my experience is in front end but i should “speak the lingo” of backend so next them they have nothing to complain about  - i am going to post my notes of the conference talks. i also went to some front end talks too and so if my coworkers see there were front end talks there as well that justifies my presence there more that it wasn’t all backend  - i can’t leave and go to a different company because i don’t have enough experience to and my only knowledge is in front end and ux design. i also truthfully make a lot of mistakes sometimes and so if i go to another company they will expect me to already be at the level instead of learning as i go. i am going to stick it out here and focus on getting better at front end and prove people wrong
am i too incompetent to be a software engineer?,cxpkk4,blank,luminous_vixen,7,1567241629.0,"i am currently a software engineer at my first job out of college, and i’m located on the east coast. for personal reasons, i’m looking to relocate to the bay area. i have gone through 6 phone screens and have bombed 5 of them. i have only gotten a working solution for 1, but for that screen i received feedback that i was too slow, needed too much guidance, and didn’t reach an optimal solution. so i’ve never made it to an on-site.  i majored in computer science in college. i have also been powering through leetcode for 4 months, and have done mock interviews because i’ve heard that the hiring process for the bay resorts to these type of questions to pass the interview. so i do have a decent amount of experience with coding and solving ds/algo questions, both by myself and in a “real” interview situation, but i’m still having trouble with medium questions. is it normal to feel like this even after 4 months of studying?  i’ve never done this kind of studying for jobs before. i was very lucky in college and didn’t have to do this kind of interview prep at all. for my current job, i was asked to do a simple online coding test, and for the phone screen i was only asked a very simple array manipulation question. it was nothing near the level of questions that companies are asking me now. i feel pretty defeated, and i feel like these last 4 months of consistent studying has been a waste.  it’s not only my failure rate for coding that i’m concerned about though. in my experience from working at my current company, i’ve found that i am much slower than the rest of my coworkers- i am constantly overwhelmed by meetings where other engineers design and plan out solutions on the spot, and find that i have a very hard time keeping up with them. i feel like i am lacking in general knowledge that i should have, too- when other engineers are asked about design/code clarifications, they are oftentimes able to answer smoothly and with confidence. but i struggle to answer back coherently when asked, and too often i feel like i have to embarrassingly reply to people that i don’t know the answer to their question. and i am not just comparing myself to senior/mid level engineers; i feel like i am lagging behind the new grads who were hired at the same time as me as well.  another note also... i’m a female. and i have many tech friends who work in the bay who constantly tell me that it’ll be easy for me to get a job there since companies there actively try to hire more women. i don’t know how true this is, but if it’s true, these rejections just make me think that if i can’t pass these interviews even as a woman, then i really must be incompetent...  am i cut out for this field? if not, what are some alternative job titles i can look into that utilize my computer science degree? i’d appreciate honesty, i’m not looking for words of encouragement (unless they are sincere/constructive)."

is the company i work for toxic?,c49g5w,blank,ennuiDB,15,1561344416.0,"i recently started working in the engineering department of a small publishing company after a leaving a really horrible startup. at first i thought it was great because the people seemed really nice and they'd offered me a promotion and more money than i'd asked for. but it's been four months now and the cracks have started to show.  the first obvious crack showed up during the first project i worked on. when i'd interviewed they told me that they wanted me to work on a greenfield project but a lot of the work had already been started (albeit without a clear plan) by another engineer before i got there which was fine. what did bother me was how defensive that engineer would get whenever i asked him about the choices he'd made when writing the application. his code was bad and he clearly didn't care. even though we have about the same yoe, he's about twice my age and i got the impression he resented me for being promoted when he hadn't. he eventually asked to be moved to a different project (weeks after i'd suggested that he be removed to my manager) and i got to work with this other really talented guy who'd joined two months after i had instead which seemed to solve that problem for the short term. however it's a pretty small department and the older engineer has had to be warned for acting in a confrontational manner towards me since then.  the second major crack was with a dev ops engineer who i had to work with briefly on an infrastructure project. similar age to the other guy and he seemed a little grumpy at first but i could at least work with him. i got the impression that he liked me too as he would praise me in front of my colleagues and didn't seem to mind when i pointed out mistakes in his prs. one evening during work drinks, i'd asked him to explain a position he'd taken in what had been a friendly debate and just out of nowhere he starts cursing and yelling and name calling like he was possessed. and he did this in front of more junior members of staff and in front of my **manager**. i tried to keep my cool but didn't back down in my line of questioning. my manager, being a typical liberal, appealed to this weird bothsidesism bs in order to ""diffuse"" the situation. i reported the dev ops guy to hr the next day who actually took his behaviour seriously enough to make him quit three weeks later. when i confronted my manager (who's about the same age as me, so mid-20s) about why he'd done next to nothing, he insisted that though the dev ops guy had been completely in the wrong, he had called my manager worse names in the past so it hadn't occurred to him to do anything about it. my manager had said something a little similar about the bad engineer from the first project i'd worked on (i.e., because older members of staff regularly disrespected him and had done at previous jobs, he had learned to just tolerate them). the dev ops guy apparently had a history of yelling at women during meetings but because the women who complained weren't engineers, nothing really happened. it later came out that the dev ops guy had hit another member of staff whilst i was in the bathroom that night and presumably my manager had said nothing about that either.  i've spoken to a few people in senior management about this and i get the impression that there's a desire to improve the culture and the engineering department as a whole. however i feel like in middle management and at the ic level - as much as i like the guys i'm working with right now - there just isn't the will to question the status quo at all. i've seen it particularly in the way in which the infrastructure was maintained - that dev ops guy essentially was the platform team before he left and he constructed a set of aws environments with brittle puppet code that just made no sense and bore no resemblance to the infrastructure i'd seen at previous companies (though to be fair, this is the first time i've had to work all that closely with infrastructure code). he also left hardly any documentation and could be quite cryptic when i asked him technical questions. prior to the incident at the bar, whenever i asked my manager if it made sense to give staff aws training, he would insist that the dev ops guy could teach us everything we needed to know. now that he's gone, guess who's expected to help pick up the pieces! =d  i guess i'm just curious as i still don't think i know what a good work environment really looks like in tech. is this normal? does my worrying about this so much make me a pussy? does this seem like the sort of place where management will learn from their hiring mistakes or should i expect the worse? what does the fact that they tolerated those toxic engineers for two years say about their hiring me (if anything)? would love to hear what you think."

"sort of ""philosophical"" question about hackerrank, leetcode, etc. -- how does it help you get better at all problem solving?",ejm6zq,blank,eframson,63,1578116229.0,"i'm having a discussion with some friends, one of whom asserts that spending time on hr, lc, etc. helps you get better at all problem solving (at least in the context of a cs job). i'm failing to see how solving the problems on those sites helps you get better at solving anything other than the problems on those sites. i'm not saying they \*don't\*, i'm just saying i'm not seeing the connection, and unfortunately my friend is unable to articulate it in any more detail than that, as he seems to view it as being more or less axiomatic.  i understand that there's value in being able to pass interviews, but i'm taking about value outside of simply getting through interviews. i graduated from my university a bit over 10 years ago, and have been working professionally in software engineering for the last 9 years. i cannot think of any of the types of ""problems"" i've had to solve in that time that would have been aided by the kind of knowledge hackerrank seems to teach.  for example, the kind of ""problems"" (in a very broad sense) i've had to solve so far in my career include, but are not limited to - ""how can we ensure a consistent experience across all browsers?"", ""the client wants x, y, and z data exported"", ""this existing product needs to be migrated to aws"", ""the client wants to know why these numbers aren't as big as they believe they ought to be."" and unfortunately i fail to see how knowing how to find, say, the median of two sorted arrays would have helped me in any of these circumstances.  i should probably add that probably contributing to my skepticism is that many of the core concepts of cs careers were entirely omitted from my cs degree program (e.g. - data structures, algorithms, big o, any math whatsoever, c/c++, testing, qa, frameworks, libraries, source control, contributing to an existing codebase, etc.) granted, in the intervening years, i have learned about a lot of these concepts while on-the-job.  however, when i have explained to co-workers all the things my degree program didn't cover that theirs did, they've pretty much all said that i need to learn about algorithms, data structures, big o in order to do my job properly. in response i've asked them ""oh, how much do you use those things in your job?"" and almost to a man (or woman), they've paused, thought about it, and said ""i guess i don't, really"".  &#x200b;  tl;dr - how generally transferable and applicable are the skills you learn on hackerrank and leetcode, \*outside\* of those specific environments and applying for jobs? or is it dependent on the job?  &#x200b;  edit: i should add, i'm not \*opposed\* to hackerrank, or learning algorithms, or whatever. i'm just asking for someone to provide an argument other than ""you're just supposed to do/learn all that stuff"""

should i confront my tech lead for his condescending way of speaking?,edtef2,blank,treesandbirds999,12,1576981726.0,"i don’t know what his deal is. but he sometimes has such a condescending and impatient way of speaking to you when you ask him a question that it makes you feel totally dumb and makes you never want to be in that position.  of course though, he’s brilliant (he is the vp’s favorite because he’s saved the company so much money) and unfireable and it is up to me to deal. i’ve worked with him for 2 months (i recently switched to the team internally) and cannot do this any longer.  i have to ask him questions since i am new to cloud engineering and don’t have context. when i ask him questions it’s a toss up between getting spoken to like i’m 8 and being talked to nicely. he talks like this to the other people on the team too (though less frequently).  i honestly don’t know if i’m just being sensitive (i’m a 29 year old woman working with primarily older men and they don’t seem to have a problem) or if i should confront him and try to communicate how interacting with him feels like, or if i should just switch to another team again.  sucks a lot since the team he leads is very technically interesting, but this guy is so demoralizing to work with.  is it worth trying to get him to be more considerate in how he talks to me?"

"happy 2020, choose your college wisely!",ej8n4i,blank,throwmeaway102314,2,1578047060.0,"it was about this time several years ago that i made the worst decision of my young life. i was 18 and thought i could conquer the world. i was in the upper 15% of my graduating class with a pretty good sat and i wanted the best out of my continued education. not having a clue what my passion was, i googled things like ""highest paying college majors"" simply because my only criteria for a line of work was success. i landed on computer science which was high on every list, and subsequently googled ""best schools for computer science"". my very generous parents took me to tour various colleges within the top 50, all of which we could not afford.  i landed on a school for stupid reasons. it was one of the better ranked cs schools i was accepted to and it had a great party scene with a lot of pretty (but heartless) girls. i did not pay attention to the cost or the inevitable loan debt i would accrue, it didn't matter because cs is such a high paying field right? well i left for school and began the worst year of my life so far. i was deeply depressed. i was failing and doing poorly in classes, i found it nearly impossible to make like minded friends, i was far from my family, and most of all i just hated my life. i contemplated suicide as i struggled with the reality of things, and if not for a pretty girl (now my wife) nearly 500 miles away, i might not be here now.  she instilled the idea of a transfer of schools into my mind. i knew that i wanted to be closer to home and subsequently closer to her. my gpa restricted my options but i found a spot in a local city close to where i am from. i transferred and left my past behind me. it was about half the price, which still was not a concern to me, but i am so glad this was the case now. i thrived here. many semesters above a 3.5, a long term and healthy relationship, regularly seeing family, tons of friends, and internships while i studied. it was so much better, and i was so much happier.  cs was no longer a means to make money, it was a passion. i started learning in my free time, which i thought i'd never want to do. i explored so many subsets of cs through youtube and [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) and just genuinely wanted to build software to solve problems. i found my way onto a full stack and let my creativity and ingenuity run wild.  i graduated, and remained in the same city i transferred to. a great paying job, but a lot of unfortunate debt. i refinanced my loans and after being granted 15 hours of overtime and working 55 hours a week, i'd have them paid off within the decade, lowering hours as my salary increased. i married the beautiful woman that inspired me to be where i am today, and i cannot express how great my life has turned around.  to all those looking at colleges or making a decision, use me as an example. do what is right and check the boxes for the attributes that matter. care not about some blogger's rankings of the institution or how much fun you will have at a party, and more about what is financially viable and will inspire you to get where you want to be. your college education is what you make it. the work you put in while being there determines what you get out of it. you could go to the best school or the worst school, if you aren't inspired to do the work, nothing good can come of it. at this point in my career, i know people without a degree at all, out-earning ivy leaguers.  i wish everyone a wonderful and prosperous new year, and all those deciding on their school the best of luck in their search. it will be a remarkable 4 years and an awakening of who you choose to become for the rest of your life."

can we add a bootcamp thread stickied at the top?,bvzsq4,blank,Youtoo2,95,1559525081.0,"i have been in the business for 20 years. we frequently get people coming on here asking about bootcamps. we have people who have had success. i remember one woman who after two years experience said she got a high paying job at amazon in new york. we have others who can't get jobs.   since there are so many posts on this they don't get many good answers because who wants to repeat the same things? i think one posted thread at the top would be really helpful. however, mods, unfortunately you going to have to go through it and delete posts that do not add to the conversation or the thread will get just too big to find anything. it would also be useful if when someone gives a positive/negative boot camp review you can add it to the first post in the thread and link to the post. this would be really helpful to people.   i am hesitant to recommend them because they are expensive and you can't work. the kind of person this appeals to likely does not have a lot of money. i do not know how to tell a really good bootcamp from a bad one. i think you can do some used car salesmen skepticism. such as do they give you the hard sell. do they not shut up. do they go on and on about how much money you will make. do they then not keep any records of job placement. do they talk about 'financial aid' in a hard sell when financial aid is just loans or its one of those persian rug stores where you get a ""sholarship"" since the full price is not really the price.   the woman who got a job at amazon said she had to pass a test and show some competence before starting. so they can give you something to study at first.   so people can name good and bad boot camps. this opens up to shitty ones just putting up fake posts, so we need to say 'take this with a grain of salt'. what to look for when screening.   i also think we can stress just how much work it is. you are basically trying to get prepared to work in a few months where a cs student has 4 years. now that student is not only taking programming, but they are getting more fundamentals and its more time to digest the knowledge. this tells me that the successful boot camp people don't just show up during the day for class. they work at it every night. they work on it on weekends. they have side projects. they read technical forums(i find these really useful). they google other documentation and practice at it. they take notes. i think most people are not mark zuckerberg. i am 100% self taught. it was a fuck ton of work over many years to get good.  if we can get a thread at the top for bootcamps/career switchers people can go through posts. i think this needs to be strongly moderated and unrelated posts should be deleted or else it will just get too long. i am not a fan of mass moderation, but something like this is important to help people out.  to those who want to do bootcamps: i honestly don't know how to pick a good one from a bad one. i don't know the success rate. all i can tell you is to use these strategies.   1. google them. if there are tons of web pages talking about how awesome it is, its like fake news posts. mlm companies do this to bury bad reviews. look on glassdoor and ripoff report  2. if they nag you to buy their product in a hard sell. its bullshit.   3. if they talk over and over again about how much money you will make, its bullshit. if they are selling their product they need to sell its a lot of work and you can do it if you work at it.  4. if they sell you on lots of jobs then do not keep data on job placement and salaries, its bullshit. even if they do some of it is bullshit. google them.   5. do they make you pass a test to start? is it a real test? about 20 years ago chubb institute had one of these bootcamps with 'scholarships'. i had to pass a test to get in. i spent 3 hours on it. none of it was coding. the 'advisor' (sales person asshole) spent 5 minutes grading and said ok you pass, but not well enough to get a scholarship, you have to pay $30,000. i had to buy their laptop and not use my own (which is cheaper). when i told him it was too expensive, he got mad at me and pointed at the door. it was clear he was on commission. have a major bullshit detector. this was 20 years ago so take into account inflation.   6. when in doubt post the name of the boot camp on here and other websites and see if anyone did it. take the answers with a grain of salt. if its too positive, there is a good chance its someone who works for the company.   7. do they stress how much work it will be? you need to work outside of regular class hours and on weekends. you need to keep working at it after you graduate. you need to do leetcode. its alot of work. no one will hire you just for showing up.   8. i also recommend people post about the company and the website and syllabus on here and other sites. note there are a lot of cs snobs on here who will tell you its garbage, but you could get some useful answers on whether its garbage or not. for cs people i got a masters in software engineering after getting a job and i have read most of the cs books in the undergrad cs curriculum. it is good material, but there are snobs on here.   i think a thread like this is something we can do to help the community. people who are looking to job transition and may buy these classes do not make a lot of money and will not be able to work. i think a big thread at the top with tips and names of good/bad bootcamps will be really helpful to people."
4 excellent tips for becoming a software engineer,e1q2ao,blank,sweetseognam,1,1574758538.0,"hi all   wanted to quickly share [this](https://learn.g2.com/software-engineer) article that has some good tips on becoming a software engineer.  the quote i found most useful from the article is from dan holmes at arc.  “throughout my experience, i've learned that it's important to be a *yes man* (or woman). that is: say yes to everything you possibly can and provide reasonable expectations for what it will take. everything is possible but not everything is profitable. finally, i've learned that on the other side of being passionate about something, is being self-disciplined.  self discipline is the difference between a coding statesman and a script kiddie. if i was going to do things differently, i'd be less stressed about where i wanted to be, and be more inclined to sit tight and lean in.”  hope you all find it useful!"
software development: how would you behave with a woman who ask you for help but spends all day surfing the web/checking social networks/chatting with others instead of working?,5rlijr,blank,cpete85,178,1486050378.0,"a coworker of mine doesn't focus on her job and is constantly either chatting using her computer or surfing facebook or checking her phone. then, when a client request arrives, she dedicates herself no more than 1 minute to it before asking for help or complaining about it or making noises or whatever...  i've catch her doing this (screwing around instead of working) more than once when she thinks nobody is looking at her. this behavior seems like a mockery because she acts either offended or ""edgy"" when me or others refuse to help her...  i am not her boss, but she seem to believe she can get away with this behavior because ""it's taken for granted that 'the team' will help her in times of need"". once she manages to get help or fix the issue or getting someone else involved, she goes back to wasting time.  she adopts the same exact behavior even when she's getting help: if me or another coworker goes to the bathroom or gets away for a few minutes, instead of picking up the slack or focusing on learning, she goes back to whatever social network she's using or chatting... it's like she doesn't like the job and does anything in her power to stay away from it, and a couple of people can't say ""no"" to her which makes it worse...  management, of course, is not aware of it because we have covered for her in the past, and she uses the guilt card a lot. now i'm starting to distance myself from her, and it turns out she comment how ""i'm not in a good mood"" lately because i'm not willing to be used like that...  am i on the right track here? is there something else i can do without reporting her to my boss and/or having to deal with her gossiping behind our backs?  **edit**: given the amount of children around, i feel compelled to clarify that i wrote she is a woman for no reason whatsoever other than the fact she's female, if a guy was doing this i would have written ""a guy a work with""..."
resume (first job hunt) - should i list my completed college coursework if i dropped out?,dz2dyu,blank,aWicca,1,1574287059.0,"first to clarify; i completed a year and half worth of coursework before dropping out, and it was one of those unavoidable life situations (i moved countries, and made ireland (dublin) my new home). i'm also (alert) a woman, lil bit older than usual graduates, with a 26 years of living around in this world. i also did self taught route for a year before attending college, and am doing it now in my - ""gap"".  i've done a bit of reading up, watching and listening to stuff related to finding that first job. and there is plenty of information about going self thought route, college graduate route, bootcamps etc. of course collage graduates have advantage, i understand that and can reason with it. i also know what should be in my resume, know about must have handful of completed projects, how to showcase it, etc. all that theory is soaked up. and what i concluded is ""get a damn degree, it makes a life easier"". and frustrated as i am - for not having the chance to finish it, i try to find any kind of advantage, an ""edge"".  initially i wanted to list only ""self taught"", disregarding my education lvl, listing some of those courses as self taught acquired skills. but now i'm thinking of using it, if i can? if i can't, i'l go back to that ""self taught"" route. so i'm basically asking should i include it in my resume or not? i have transcripts with me, do i need them? what should i say?  i'm hoping to get that first job in half a year, so any additional tips would be appreciated. should i attend some sort of bootcamp to boost resume a bit? are online bootcamps worth it? (i find it hard to find any bootcamps in dublin that focuses primarily on c++, and i'm most interested in it, as that is almost only language that i know, and i prefer backend anyway).  or to contrast all of this - should i just go back to collage, but in dublin? i don't like this solution very much - as i need to have steady income (that's why i moved - from croatia), and it's kind of expensive. and - i need to wait for it almost a year.  my completed coursework include: computer architecture, digital techniques and microprocessor, linear algebra with a use of matlab, math analysis with a use of matlab, basics of electronics and basics of electrical engineering, c language, html + css + javascript basics, sql data bases 1 and 2, informational systems, c++, numerical math with a use of matlab, and at last algorithms.  thanks a bunch for any sort of guidance!"
how do you even transition from politics to the tech sector?,djbagr,blank,overcharing,4,1571369193.0,"&#x200b;  i'm done with politics. it has lofty goals (sometimes!), and often time you do good work, but i'm done. so done.   and, so, here i am, thinking of the next chapter in this non-traditional career journey of mine. i've been thinking long and hard, and i've figured that i honestly want to make the jump into tech. i'm a risk-taker (within reason, always), and i want to develop new skill-sets. i want to build things, and in the process, continue to re-build myself up too.   only issue? i've got a political science background, nonprofit and government experience, and no tech skills-sets. whatsoever. a real bummer.   i'm also a 29 year-old woman, and i make $120,000 and pretty high up in the hierarchy of  government in a major city, and oversee $4bn in projects... so not really excited to starting from the bottom. so what gives?   do i go through a bootcamp? is that worth it? maybe go for a pm role even though no tech background? if so, how do you even do that? anyway, you get the gist. i'm pretty much lost. and i really need help."

i feel like a fraud...,bc19ks,blank,HansTheProgrammer,26,1555025570.0,"... for working as a programmer.     i'll try to keep this short, but i can't promise anything.  i'm a 20 year old guy in austria, who finished a good technical college and loves programming. i've managed to get a job at a rather small company (not a startup) as _junior java developer_. have been working there for 6 months now.  until just 2 weeks ago i didn't write a single line of code at work. all i did 40+ hours a week, is online documentation. 2 weeks ago i basically finished the whole documentation platform and there was nothing else to do, so they ""allowed"" me tp program.  i really like my colleagues and work overall isn't _that_ bad (despite all the above). but there is this weird woman in her thirties. don't get me wrong, i get along with her quite well and she is an absolute beast when it comes to work. she easily does the work of 2 developers in half the time (well, her code quality reflects that..., but still).   anyways, we have a few different applications. some bigger, some smaller. but most of them are **huge**. the one i have to work on is by far the biggest. i even asked my boss if it's just me and my lack of experience or if it's really that big and messy. \ he just said: ""well, it's no photoshop or ms office, but it's no joke"".   the 30ish woman i'm working with is supposed to mentor me a bit. teach me how the application works, what it does, the flow of it etc. instead, she just expects me to know it all and if i even dare to ask for help, she'll usually say ""just debug it and try to understand"" - _or_ she will just take the ticket, assign it to herself and do it. in that case, i always review the pull request and 95% of the time i understand what's going on or what she did - but this is frustrating. especially when there are methods with 250+ lines of code inside of them or 12 parameters. maybe this is normal in a professional setting/application - i wouldn't know since this is my first job as a programmer.  it has come to the point where i seriously question my abilities as java developer. i ask myself questions like ""should i be able to understand this quicker?"", ""am i doing something wrong?"", ""am i even allowed to call myself programmer?"". it's just embarrassing and i feel like a fraud of sorts... like i shouldn't even have this position.  out of 10 hours at work i spend at least 8 just debugging and _trying_ to understand this monster of a project. day-in day-out, for 2 weeks straight.  i'm asking you guys, out of despair, is this normal? \ maybe my programming capabilities just aren't as good as i thought. \ i'm getting things done, i implement features and i am part of the sprint. but i constantly have to ask questions and my tickets take way longer than they should. _i really don't know what to do._  _edit:_ just to clarify: she is not my boss. my boss assigned her to me. i think i'm just an inconvenience to her and her work. she sort of _expects_ me to know my way around the application."
my coworker keeps attacking my reputation behind my back and i don't know how to stop her,ajcdz5,blank,stephen_rex,78,1548365173.0,"our boss gave her webdesign work when she first join the company (web agency) even though she had never done it before. i helped her a lot until i no longer had the time and that's when she started criticizing me for my lack of ""collaboration"".  eventually she stopped trying whatsoever to learn and used to wait for me to have free time so i could tell her how to do her job. i didn't like it so i stopped this behavior and went my own way.  she kept complaining and criticizing me behind my back (even though i wasn't the one giving her work) until our boss transferred her.  three years passed since she joined us, and many situations like these arose in that time. last month one of the projects i analyzed and estimated was assigned to her by my boss. i hadn't worked on it. i didn't want any trouble so i prepared everything for her to do the job: research, specifications, test scripts, etc. it didn't matter.  the job was frontend development and she hates that, but my boss gave it to her anyway, and instead of taking it out on him, she started taking it out on me. everything that didn't work she blamed on me, trying to say that my research was wrong, my test scripts were wrong, that i hand't tested anything, etc. all of this behind my back.  and all of it wrong. everytime she came to me with a problem, we eventually found out it was caused by her. and besides, it wasn't even my project, it was assigned to her, so i don't see why she insisted on blaming me, and it pisses me off.  last week she found her app wasn't working on android devices. i told her i had tested it on android before so if it wasn't working it was either because of a recent andorid update (my tests were 3 months old) or the way the library was being used.  she went into maternity leave earlier and i was assigned her project. i took charge, found out the error and fixed it. it was, in fact, caused by the browser, not the code.  she came back in today to ""turn her computer off"" and say her goodbyes before giving birth. she turned her computer on and went through my commits, found the bugfix and texted a coworker of mine saying (behind my back): ""i know i'm a bad person but i went through his commits... *fixed android bug*... wait, hadn't he say he had tested it on android devices?!?!?!""  everything's like this. it's either do what she says or wait for her to start saying crap behind my back, and that crap reaches my boss ears. and i still can't believe she kept trying to blame me till the last day about something she couldn't do that i hadn't assigned her just because i wasn't willing to do her job.  wtf can i do to stop this woman from doing this to me?"

i'm a tech professional who's spent a fair amount of time in the job market. after i left my previous job i felt that i needed time for some life maintenance, so i did not jump immediately back into the job market. within weeks, several recruiters began to contact me. i left the door open to possibility and decided to entertain their offers.  since that time here's what's happened:  recruitment company a contacts me via linkedin. one thing leads to another, they ""interviewed"" me internally over the phone and skype and none of the opportunities materialize. then i'm led to another ""opportunity"" that requires my ssn to apply. at this point i declined, stating that maybe if this were a government job i would understand the need for an ssn, and then the line with this company goes dead.  fast forward about a month. local recruitment company b, among others, contacts me with a job offer that sounds very provocative. everything seems normal over the course of several conversations, up until the point before we begin talking about interviews for the job, and i'm presented with an online skills assessment test (i'll call it the mystery test), and from a then-unknown third party company. i'm told i cannot even proceed with further steps with the supposed client until i take the mystery test. i've done similar things before, but i want to prepare, so i begin doing research on the mystery test. all i can find on it are a few posts on reddit with mixed results (some did well, some did not). it's an adaptive test that's designed to get harder as the test progresses, and there's no way to ascertain the amount of material that may be covered, nor is there any way to practice or prepare for the test. so basically this recruiter is asking me to undress and expose myself for inspection, in a sense, and trust them with the use of whatever information this test produces. i talked to my lawyer about my concerns who advised me to not take it, and i contacted recruitment company b about my concerns on the grounds that this assessment is not an industry standard and could be materially harmful in the wrong hands, and i asked for alternatives. none were given and i declined the opportunity. suddenly the line went dead among three recruiters who i had been in contact with at that time.  fast forward another month or so. recruitment company a contacts me again, over the phone this time, but it's a different recruiter. she has an amazing job opportunity, something that really appeals to me. it's a contract-to-hire government job with the state (it didn't dawn on me until later that i had mentioned government work with this company the first time). she forwards me to a ""manager"" for further questioning. this manager interviews me shortly, and notifies me that she is going to email me a skills test and such. not long afterward, linkedin pings me with a contact request from this woman. i received the test in email, and it's the same mystery test sent to me by recruitment company b. i am immediately suspicious at this point, i searched for this job opportunity through the state's website, but found nothing, so i called around. i'm still waiting for confirmation from the technology management & budgeting department, but i was first forwarded up to a civil services commission who informed me that the state does not work with third-party recruiters, and that they use their own resources.  apparently something highly suspicious may be happening here. a few years ago i almost fell victim to a fraudulent company praying on tech job seekers. there may not be a connection, but i at least have reason to be worried about malicious tactics out there.  reddit, i need any insight, advice or information that you have about what may be going on, or about what to do. thanks.   edit: i'm not sure why people are hung up on the test itself, but since there are so many questions about it [here is some info](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/37ks28/am_i_just_dumb_for_doing_this_badly_on_the_ikm/) on the actual test. it's not for java only, and can be configured to test on different subjects. again, it's an adaptive test that is basically designed to find out what you fail at, so if you aren't 100% perfect at the given subject matter it almost seems guaranteed to come up with info on your flaws as a coder.  again, it's not that this test is harmful in and of itself, but there are other things going on here, like a lie about a job opportunity, and multiple, supposedly locally based recruiting companies who appear to be working together in some way, and i want to know what their motivations are.  edit2: i did a little more digging on the exam. i found a [data sheet](https://www.ikmnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ikm-report-analysis.pdf) that states the following:  *all information generated throughout the assessment process is stored in a secure ikm hid™ (human intelligence database) for future use, whether its for training, recruitment or other hr initiatives. you may produce reports for additional analysis at any level, including individual, project team, departmental or enterprise-wide. you can even compare results to the entire ikm assessment-taker population for industry standard benchmarking.*  so apparently if you take this test your info goes into a database that can be accessed by many prospective employers."

discrimination in tech presentations,bbtl8a,blank,BadPresenter,21,1554971099.0,"ok, this is not a troll post. anyone who suggests/promotes: legal action, hateful speech, dramatization of situation, escalation, or extrapolation to other situations/trends; i don’t want to hear it. this is the first case i’ve heard and believe. misogyny is far more common and a larger issue then misandry. being a white man i do not experience discrimination so blatantly, this leaves me (thankfully) ill-equipped to deal with this so suggestions welcome.   story: my friend a, white male, is the core maintainer of an open source library. he was there from day 1 when there used to be a team around it. team left now he is core contributor, with random people pitching in occasionally. he leveraged this library to do something cool and was about to demo it at a conference. i work at a big 5, so we have demo program managers. they barred him from presenting because “we have too many men presenting already”, however they still want to present the content so they will “find a woman”. this was collected in a call not recorded in text or otherwise.   my friend does many presentations. he is also a stud so he doesn’t really care, but it miffed him a little. he says this has happened before but subvertly, so its a little easier to swallow in past, also in other cases: there’s usually a woman on the team who can fill (justifiably so!) to ensure we can increase exposure and promote diversity (which is a good thing).   this case is different because 1) they literally said that shit in a call. 2) he’s the sole contributor at this point, they literally stripped his team and are still pushing this shit at conferences to look good. now they want to find some random woman from some random team to present his work as her own.   i’m working on something where i may be in his shoes shortly and curious how to mitigate.   what would you do? how would you navigate politically? thoughts/experiences? this ship has sailed but how would you prepare to mitigate risk in an environment like that for next time?   again: please don’t make this political. only practical advise. again: if he had a woman on his team who contributed, totally fine. again: this is my first experience with this in my 4 years at the company and 1 year on this team. i’ve seen many more cases of misogyny and feel more comfortable reporting that then something like this, especially with no evidence.  his manager already threw a fit and said at least give us a female head who can be dedicated to project (at least the demo) so she can present and be knowledgeable. pm refused and said he’d boot the demo from conference. most parties want this demoed, pulling demo would be politically unwise for my friend and his manager, as the demo people can find another demo and management wants this demo presented."
first software engineering job out of college is awful for all the reasons i didn't expect,9b3hwq,blank,iceSeraph,131,1535524183.0,"hi reddit.  i'm sorry if these kinds of questions get boring, but i just feel absolutely at a loss at what to do.  i’m sorry if this kind of rambles on, i’m honestly feeling pretty bad about the day.   i graduated from a good school in december 2017 with a cs degree and, by the end of march, i had scored and started a job. everything was great. i was getting paid what i considered to be a good amount for the area i live in, and my boss and coworkers seemed really nice. it was a small company, but i didn't mind because at the time i was enthusiastic about programming and treating this as a time to really hone my skill.   yeah, about that.  i'm currently 5 months in and absolutely regret everything and it's all due to one person.   my qa lady at this small company seems to hate me.   my first month at the company i did not come into contact with her at all (she works in a different office building than i do), and everything was swell. then, i was assigned to the project that she does qa for. i treated this as any other project, and for the first week or so i figured i would be getting used to the new project, spending a little bit of extra time to make sure i was understanding everything correctly. within the first week she called my manager to complain that i was too slow at solving issues that i was assigned. i know this because my office is extremely open concept and i got to hear the entire conversation about how i am too slow. i assume all my coworkers heard as well, though i never actually asked them.  this continued. there were actually multiple occasions in the first two months of working with her where the subject of me came up of me being too slow at my issues, and not doing things right. at this point i had been with the company about 3 months. and yes, the complaints about me could be heard by the entire office every single time.   as time has gone on, nothing has improved. in fact, it's only gotten much, much worse.  to give you an example, today our qa sites were down. i messaged her to tell her that “hey, things are messed up now but they’ll be back up shortly!” and then a few minutes later another message of - “everything is fixed now!”. she then sent 6 paragraphs scolding me for using the word “everything” because it’s too unclear, and perhaps it meant that i had rebooted every single environment that the company has. this, or something similar to this, happens during every interaction we have.  i  not to mention, when a bug is found in my code, she calls another developer on the phone and tells them to immediately go talk to me about the “issues” i’ve created. so i get scolded by my fellow developers too, as they are always annoyed that they have to do this and, honestly, it’s embarrassing. even if i know the issue that has happened and try to explain, they will basically make me erase all my code and then rewrite it (sometimes the exact same things) while they watch over my shoulder.  it’s honestly just embarrassing and i hate turning in code at this point.   that leads us to today. today, qa lady yelled at me pretty much nonstop, 8 hours, sending multiple people to yell at me. and responded to every single update i put on jira, etc, with passive aggressive messages telling me what i am doing wrong. i always apologize, and never ever argue. but before i leave work, i get an im from the cto of the company to come talk to him. :( basically she complained so much that i’ve gotten a warning and, i think it was implied, if things don’t change i won’t have a job anymore.  i thanked him for his time and left.   reddit, i don’t know what to do. this woman has made my job feel so toxic and i dread going every day because i fully expect to get yelled at and talked down to daily.  it seems like none of the other devs in this office have ever had this issue, though it’s well known that this woman is…. not well liked. i feel like i can’t leave without it looking bad because it has only been 5 months, but i dread going to work everyday and i can honestly say i despise my job, for every reason except the work that i do.   am i being to dramatic, or would you guys agree that this is toxic? what would you guys do?"

some students, however, because of the fact that we had to learn so much in 6 months, were really good at convincing our instructors they knew more than they actually did. the student that is on my team is one of those students: i feel bad for him in a sense, because on one hand, we both need to do well on this internship to get good recommendations to get hired after its over, or even possibly taken on by the company. but if i had to describe his level of skill, it's like... trying to explain geometry to someone who only knows arithmetic. i wouldn't mind helping him if it weren't for the fact that he's stubborn.  let me give an example: we work with mostly ruby and ruby on rails in our company, and not much else besides front-end technologies (html, css, and js). he was attempting to teach himself sql, python, django, and c++ at the **same time**, and three of those technologies are not anything we're using at our company; i tried to explain to him that python is not something we're using, and he said he ""wanted to learn it anyway"" because he doesn't like being corrected. as a result, he doesn't even know the syntax of ruby yet, and our supervisor ended up having to tell him exactly what i did during a meeting that we don't use python, and that he recommended he didn't learn it right now. i also warned him not to be doing several tutorial series at once on one subject, because in my experience, it throws me off and makes things take longer (decision fatigue is very real, and it slows down the learning process for me when i can't even decide which book or video series i'm consuming that day). i feel alot of the times that he is afraid of coming off like he doesn't know anything, so he attempts to make himself look good, which results in him learning even less than he could from this rare experience. **the issue is that we have recently been told that we have to create an app for the company...** ***together***. i have never done this before, but i do know the concepts involved: we have to make a database, find an api so people can book reservations with the app, create a backend, link it to the front end, etc. what i don't know, i at least know how to find out how to do it. he doesn't understand basic concepts and has barely ever written basic scripts like a cli calculator (thus the arithmetic/geometry analogy earlier) and will ask for help, but will then completely deviate from what you tell him to do -- i explained to him that there's an order to the things he needs to learn... that he needs to at least know what composes a web app (what http is, apis, json, etc.) before he starts working on one. he just barraged me with questions earlier today, then directly after me trying to (once again, the analogy) explain geometry to someone who knows arithmetic, he tried to instruct me on what task i should do first. i was livid. i stood my ground and reminded him (in the most professional language possible) of the fact that i've been his personal google machine the last two weeks, so maybe i should be the one delegating tasks (he backed down after that) i do feel like some of his issues stem from the fact that i'm a woman, and maybe it hurts his pride or something having to come to me for help (this happened a few times during school actually)  my point is, i'm at a loss how to handle this. i feel like this guy found his way into this internship not knowing as much as he's supposed to, which is fine -- i would feel bad for him if it weren't for the fact that he doesn't take criticism well. i am tired of him riding my coat tails -- before he tried instructing me (the person who has been instructing him these last two weeks) what to do on this app, he messaged me to find out what i was doing/studying. because whenever i tell him, he begins working on the same thing i am even if it's a one-person job: if i told him i was working on the database for this project, he'd immediately start creating a database too... the exact same one with the exact same data i'm making, because he's afraid of not looking busy and literally has no clue how to do anything without my help he's not independent, and is riding my coat-tails, and by the time i'm halfway finished with this app, he'll actually know enough to do something to help me on it. he wants me to assign him tasks but if i do, he'll be coming to me every 3 minutes asking me what to do next(he's done this to a coworker who's been hired from the same program we came from, to the point where he became visibly annoyed), and absolutely won't listen when i try to tell him what he can do next, leading himself down some kind of rabbithole (""hey, i know you told me to make a database, but i decided to teach myself html and css and started making the front end!"") and whatever he makes, i'll end up having to fix it, thereby making this whole app take even longer to make.  we have a representative that we're supposed to report to who monitors our progress during internship and helps us negotiate salary if they decide to hire us, provide us with moral support, etc. we have the same rep since we're on the same internship, and i don't know how to let him know that he literally can't contribute to this project rn without making me sound like a dick who ""just doesn't want to help your fellow classmate in need""(staff often reminds us to help eachother, but he doesn't want the help, so idk what the heck i'm supposed to do). i'm also debating finding some kind of way to delegate him busy work... i'm just really annoyed by how all over the place this guy is. like legit, i could finish this app in a month or so i'm sure, and by the end of the month, he'll have finished picking up rails and will be ready to actually help."
job offer rescinded after i mentioned i was transgender. i need help determining if this sounds like discrimination.,8qzxi5,blank,ComprehensiveRope424,76,1528990030.0,"for context, this job was at a software company headquartered in sf, however the office i would be working at was a small satellite office in washington state.   i'm aware legal advice would be a better place to post this, however i would really like the opinions of people in the field i am in, and if you guys have experienced anything like this. i posted this in the transgender subreddit about 2 weeks ago, but i wanted to get the opinion of this subreddit as to whether i should actually consider this discrimination or not, and what, if any, action i should take. i'm not angry anymore about it, but if it does sound like discrimination, i want to do something to warn other lgbt people like me about this company.   i'm a transgender woman, meaning i was born male but transitioned to female. i'm rather far along in my transition to the point where you would have no clue i was born male by looking at me or talking to me, so i'm positive they didn't know i was trans by meeting me. my name and gender have also been legally changed, although this was only done about 6 months ago. these have never been my real names, but for simplicity sake, i'm going to say my previous male name was ""shawn"" and my current legal name is ""sarah"".  i'll start with the onsite interview. everything up to this point was rather standard. i had a phone screen, talked with the hiring manager over the phone, and then they invited me for a final interview. while going in for my interview i was a bit taken aback by the lack of diversity in the office. i mean i know the tech field isn't exactly known for having a lot of women or minorities, but i saw absolutely no diversity in that office. i'll admit the office was rather small at only 25 people, but i would at least think i would see at least one woman or person of color there. nope. of the 15 or so people i saw in the main area, there wasn't a single woman or person of color. every person who interviewed me as well was a white guy.  the interview however, went really well.    two days go by and i get a phone call from a recruiter (internal i'm pretty sure, and the only woman i talked to throughout the entire hiring process) telling me they absolutely loved my background, and that the team loved me, and that they were really excited about me. she said pending references and background check, they were going to extend a job offer. she told me to send her my references, and i did (although i'm not sure why, she was already calling the references on my resume while i was typing up the email about my references). my last two jobs knew me as sarah, however three jobs ago everyone knew me as shawn except the general manager, whom i told before i left i was transgender, and if someone called asking for sarah, then that was me. well i found out the day before my general manager didn't work there anymore, so i mentioned to the recruiter that they could call that place if needed, but that i was known by a different first name, so refer to me as shawn. she didn't say anything about it in the response email, and just said she would call my references within the next couple days (again by that point she had already called my references). well a couple business days go by, and i got a call saying that they had found another candidate that interviewed at the last second and they decided to go with him instead. she just kept going on on how great he was and how he matched all of my qualifications. seriously, she went on for like 2 minutes about how he was a better candidate than me, and how the team went back and forth between us, and why he fits the business's needs better. she said the team still really liked me and wanted to keep in touch in case another position opens, but she hinted it was rather unlikely.  so now this is where i need help determining if this sounds like discrimination or if they really did find a better candidate at the last second. i mean, if they did find a better candidate, good for them, but do you really need to tell me why he is so much better than me. i mean in my mind that is just really unprofessional and suspicious. it just seemed like she was trying to cover the company's ass by overselling it.   anyways, does this sound like discrimination? or is this pretty standard in the software world? have any of you guys experienced anything like this? this would have been my first software job btw.  tldr: got a call from a company saying they were going to extend an offer pending reference and background check. told them i used to go by a previous name while sending over references, couple days later the offer was rescinded."

how should i react when i get interrupted by more senior engineers? or am i being too sensitive?,eavbxy,blank,flowersandwine999,32,1576418392.0,"i'm currently a 28 year old software engineer who is female working on a team primarily comprised of older men who are more senior and experienced than i am. i try not to be intimidated and i try to be assertive, but i find that i still get interrupted a whole lot.  this scenario happens frequently:  me: hi joe, could we talk about this design idea i have for how to architect this piece of the system?  joe: sure! what's on your mind?  me: for implementing the backend database, i think we should use a nosql--  another more senior engineer on the team two desks away: joe, i fixed the client code and submitted a patch for it. it turns out the issue was an invalid function call that failed out but never got checked.  joe: oh! it works now?  \*joe walks to the other guy's desk to look at his computer\*  sometimes the joe will apologize with ""sorry, let me go take a look at what he's saying"" before going off to the other coworker's computer. usually i'm left sitting there waiting for them to finish before i can continue with my conversation with joe.  i think it's infuriating and completely disrespectful, and frankly i'm getting way sick of it. i don't think it's even the gender, i think it's because i'm less experienced as a software engineer and younger. though the gender probably doesn't help.  part of me questions whether i am being too sensitive, whether this is not a big deal and that the more senior engineer's priority should come first since they're more senior, etc.  my questions are:  1. do i have a right to feel upset or am i being way too sensitive about this issue? 2. if this behavior isn't okay, how should i address it or call them out on it? i was thinking something with humor but i can't think of anything funny"

early career (3yoe) advice - promotion vs leaving,dgl2l3,blank,shrazzzy,1,1570855706.0,"hi everyone!    i’ve lurked on this subreddit a while, but only now do i have a situation that’s left me at a crossroads.     about me: i’m at \~3 yoe as a software engineer at a large (but not tech) company. i’d been working very diligently towards a promotion to the software engineer 2 level. now that it’s time for this promotion to finally happen (or atleast i thought), i just found out that for the last 8 months since a re org, no one in our subgroup of \~50 people has been getting any promotions due to a logistical issue. management is aware of the issue but not much is being done about it.    the work itself is fairly decent, i work in technologies that are somewhat on par with industry standard but to be honest you can imagine my experiences as a <25 year old female in a team of 8 male developers over the age of 40. basically, i end up getting assigned a lot of grunt work/get left out of certain decision making processes.     i know i need to leave (i think?), but i’m struggling with my exit strategy. i live in a major city in california (not in the silicon valley).     at this experience level, i could either sit around at my current role for another year and apply for senior level positions afterward. but if i did that i’d be pretty unmotivated this year since there’s not really much room for upward movement/learning new technologies. there’s a chance management will do something about the logistical issue with promotions and i could be moved up in the meantime too?     or i could get out of my current role now at the same level (or at the software 2 level), hopefully be more motivated/learn more at another job. the idea of studying for interviews again is frankly a little terrifying seeing how competitive things have gotten in the three years it’s been since i last applied.    there could definitely be other options i'm failing to see as well.    thanks for reading!"

is it true that companies have a reserved quota when hiring males/females for positions?,529vbd,blank,threwawayforme,59,1473647008.0,"i might get hammered for this but i don't care. there was an interesting discussion on this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmen/comments/5244oa/my_wife_and_i_work_in_the_same_industry_with_the/) that i am quoting below from:    it's not an assumption. i have witnessed women that have graduated from the same courses of study as myself - who by their own admission are inexperienced and lacking in knowledge/expertise within a section of the field we studied in - be hired into positions that are at odds with their weaknesses.   they relayed to me that they were specifically told during the job interview that the company was looking to hire only female graduates. male graduates i knew who would have been perfectly suited to these positions were interviewed but not hired, and were also not told about the female-only hiring policy.  i am not going to start a sexism war here but i seriously would like to know how the internal politics of hiring graduates work. if you take a look at yahoo for example, i've heard from someone that a few years back (friend's family friend - he worked some upper manager level position but quit yahoo some years back), they happened to hire female graduates for higher level positions while hiring few male for average dev-related position. the man told me there were so many young male graduates who he interviewed had such promising talents with good academic records and professional intenrship experience, yet they were all turned down based on the hiring process politics by company.   i often wonder when it comes to companies hiring graduates, **are there times when companies are specifically looking to hire female graduates instead of males but they don't mention on their job postings? is there biased hiring when it comes to males vs females graduates?**  ------------  **edit:** (based on reading the replies so far) oh man, this is bad for men.   ------------  **edit2:** brought back a memory and though i should share: this incident was with my father (in the past few years back). he applied for a software dev position and the interviewer was a female (director). she rejected him with no reasonable explanation even though he knew he was qualified. after a few days after his interview, the position closed and was opened up again by the company a month later. he applied, interviewed again but with a male director instead; he was accepted."

2.5 years of recruiting journey,bvzj6o,blank,macaron2017,17,1559523687.0,"(tl;dr - thoughts after rejected by google twice)  **about me** : female, computer science undergrad, 4 yrs of experience  i was recently rejected by google after onsite for a second time. before this, i also interviewed onsite around dec, 2016.  **dec 2017**  from dec 2016 to dec 2017, i was looking for a new job because the company i worked for at the time was not doing well. let's call it company x. there was massive cost cutting and number of employees in our location needed to be reduced by half.  my team was not on the list to reduce headcount, but the company has not been making a profit in 3 years at that point and there was also no new hiring. $0 salary increase. yearly bonus was around 4k-5k range. random people i know were leaving left and right.  during that period of time, i got 4 onsite rejections which i wrote about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7gxorj/failed_4_onsites_looking_for_some_insights/).  looking back at the post i wrote before, my weakness was not just on system design or the lack of experience/exposure to system/architect decisions.  i was also weak on ds/algo. i only did \~30 leetcode type questions. and i was mostly doing the easy ones. looking back, i realized that i was ""solving"" coding questions during interviews, but i took maybe 30min to write brute force solutions, that i didn't have time to optimize. even if i had time to optimize, i didn't know enough algo/ds to do so.  an example would be, if someone asked me what a heap is. i can talk about its runtime, how to insert in it and etc. but i didn't know what problems can a heap solve. the same can be said about sorted maps.  **apr 2018**  i didn't fully understand my weakness in ds/algo, i kept applying and 5 months later, i got an offer from a company y. and also a verbal offer from a large hedge fund.  the verbal offer fell through. something with the hiring committee didn't approve. even though the manager has called me several times after my onsite saying things like ""we are working on putting an offer together."" i wasn't very surprised about it falling through because it dragged on for 6 weeks without an actual paper offer. desperate to get out of my job at company x, i accepted the offer at company y.   these 2 companies' interview process were more like easy leetcode questions + some javascript questions + experience (talk about what you worked on before).  **today**  a google recruiter emailed me early this year to my university email. i'm not sure how. either because they have some system that says she interviewed with us 2 year earlier, let's see if she improved. or the first time in 2016, i was interviewed because a friend referred me. so maybe, that referral still has some weight years later?  i told her that i need to think about it and get back to her. i ultimately decided that it doesn't hurt to try. and so i did the phone interview round again in march and passed. afterwards, i did a solid 1 month of leetcode. almost every day i practiced, the day before my onsite, i was at 127 questions. i got rejected again. the recruiter said ""there is not enough positive feedback.""  the day i got the rejection email, i was pretty sad. since double rejection hurts more than the first rejection. and it's a first to get rejected twice lol.  i can only be sure that 2 out of the 4 technical ones went well because 1 interviewer told me ""normally people don't get this far in this question."" the other interviewer said ""o(1) is the best we can do.""  the other 2, i  didn't have the optimized solution. either time ran out. or maybe i took a different turn and took too long to write a brute force. there was no lc-hard questions for me.  so if you haven't mastered mediums, focus on medium first.  now, i have snapped out of sadness. i want to continue to apply elsewhere and not waste all the prep work that i did. and use some [interview.io](https://interview.io) type platform to identify weak areas to improve. after a second time going through it, google's process is still easier than 2sigma and the goldman onsite that i had. easier because those 2 companies not only covered ds/algo coding exercises, they also had questions on oop, system design, web related questions and database questions. (not saying i prefer this whole knowledge + coding test modal).  i'm simply realizing that i still have a long way to go in terms of interview prepping.  **what's the problem with my current team?**  at this point, you are probably wondering why i still want to change job. company y is doing better than company x. there is no frequent going-away drinks to attend. my team at y grew after i joined. but some of them are beyond difficult to work with. almost daily i get some passive aggressive and micro-managing. and the team lead frequently minimize my work in front of the whole team (maybe not on purpose because the person is not very technical). let's say a task needs some change that team lead proposed. i said ""okay, this will take me a day."" team lead will say ""why? it's just some formatting."" maybe the team lead was technical at some point in his/her life. but after i joined, he/she definitely has not made any code change. a huge task with 6 sub-task would be labelled ""minor abc improvements"" and then assigned to me. none work related stuff: my team would say something mean about the food i eat. so each day, i don't feel motivated to go.  company x was cutting employees, but my old team were pleasant to work with and were delivering many impactful features out frequently, solving interesting problems. but for a junior dev like me, i really couldn't be in an environment with $0 salary increase for long since i didn't start at a high salary to begin with. at the end of the day, i can't really say i regret coming to company y. but working with mean people is not fun. and very bad for my sanity. that's why i will continue to try, apply to places and keep studying."

full stack sw developer turn tech pm after a career break is wondering if it’s better to return back to being a full stack sw engineer.,aaut62,blank,techie_needs_advice,14,1546193683.0,"32 year old female sw developer had to take a career break for caring for family. i kept in touch with the tech world ofcourse. when i was ready to re-enter the work force, i returned as a technical pm. i made this choice just because i was good at project management and talking to various people across the organization to get the job done. i worked hard on re-educating myself via online tutorials and certifications like csm and cspo and got a seemingly dream gig as a tech pm for one of the big 5s. but the hourly rate i got was undercut so bad by the consulting agency that it was extremely demotivating.  i am thinking of ways, i could get back to higher paying gigs. maybe enterprise companies; maybe startup, maybe as a full stack sw engineer. i am absolutely open-minded on this.  during this time, i have also been trying to apply to various companies as a tech pm. since my last gig was for one of the big 5s, i get lot of interest.   so in lieu of a masters or exec mba, i figured i could do a bootcamp to turn technical again and also to open doors to companies that could offer better opportunities. i am ofcourse more interested in the ones offering job guaranteed and/or even tuition deferred.   —full stack sw engineer (hack reactor)  —app developer (app academy)  —data analytics(métis, springboard, uc berkeley extension) —product school ( for becoming a ft product owner in an up and happening startup or newer companies)  —cybersecurity bootcamp   —gracehopper program  the main concern few folks have mentioned that i am older and that this can make it harder to get hired as an engineer.  even if hired, they said i possibly can’t keep up with the time that younger engineers with no familial responsibilities can put in. but to me it means that i may possibly get better opportunity to be remote and not having to be on 24/7; as a tech pm.  i can even get trained in data analytics and get hired as a data analyst.  i am ok to work as a test automation engineer too. or a security engineer or devops. just would like to get back to having better opportunities. and a more promising career.  to most of my friends irl, this seems like a step down but i am trying to increase my payscale and perhaps have atleast remote working opportunities.  tl;dr: tech pm consultant wondering if it’s better to convert into a full stack sw engineer for better opportunities in the bay area."
is there really hiring discrimination based on name? i applied to 50 different companies with 2 different names,600a4u,blank,thanksmnd,191,1489813374.0,"**skip the next 3 paragraphs if you don't want to read a bunch of contextual info.**   let me preface this by saying that this isn't a scientific study or anything even close. it was an project for one of my arts electives and i thought i'd just share the results here. i'm not going to jump to or make any conclusions about the industry as a whole, but i think my results are in line with what actual studies say about application call back rates based on name.   i'm a caucasian male. however, my parents were hippies and gave me a traditionally indonesian name, and it also happens to be mostly given to girls and sounds feminine. they also combined their last names when they got married and my last name sounds korean (my dads last name was lee so its leexxx). never really thought about it much, actually quite liked my name. anyhow, my sociology professor thought it was really interesting and encouraged me to do some kind of final project surrounding my name. since i was applying for internships anyways, i thought it would be easy and interesting to just apply twice to the same companies, but with different names.   my resume has one previous internship at a mid-sized but not tech company, and one interesting class project. i had troubles getting interviews for this summer, but i attributed it to my lack of experience and no side projects. without changing any other content on the resume other than the name, i made a fake email and started applying twice to the same companies. i did change the formatting a bit so it wasn't too obvious, but everything else stayed the same. the fake name i chose was connor miller, so it was clear that the applicant was a caucasian male.    i applied to 50 different companies using my real name and the fake name, mainly large and some local companies i was going to apply for anyways. applied for most of them from january - february and waited until last week for the results.   * real me: 6 rejections, 2 coding challenges, 2 interviews * connor miller: 4 rejections (3 of the same companies), 2 coding challenges (both same), 5 interviews (1 same)   this was pretty surprising to me, to be frank. i knew and read on the news that people discriminated based on gender and race, but i didn't think it was this significant, nor did i think it would affect me. someone with the same credentials as me could land more interviews solely because they would have a whiter/more masculine name. i'm not even a minority or a female and i feel pretty cheated.    i'm not going to change my name, but what can i and others with more ethnic names do to about this issue? is it just a fact of life and our society? how have your experiences been on this issue?"
dressing well and the tech industry?,5xds2r,blank,inepte,61,1488611863.0,"i'm about to graduate next year, and this question has been weighing on me a bit. last summer, i interned on the west coast for a major tech company and i noticed that most people didn't put a lot of effort into their appearance; a lot of the male swes on my team work old t-shirts and board shorts with sandals. women also dressed pretty casually. my new york casual felt overdressed for california, and i ended up ""dressing down"" a lot, so to speak. growing up, it's always been a kind of dream of mine to be able to wear the business-casual kind of look daily (sheath dresses, nice blouses with pencil skirts, blazers, heels), i was wondering if that's even feasible. was what i witnessed last summer representative of tech in general? are there any companies/locations where this wouldn't be too dressy? do any women, in particular, have any advice on dressing for the industry (from your experience, does what you wear change others' treatment of you, and in your opinion, would it be for the best to ""dress down"", not just necessarily in terms formality, but also femininity when at work?)"

starting a new job when i know i might have to move next year. am i doing the right thing?,4oeozr,blank,__cscq_throwaway,4,1466128787.0,"i got laid off in march and have been on unemployment since. multiple attempts to find a new job failed, many of them in frustrating ways. last month, one of my best friends, who i went to college with and have known for over a decade, suggested that i apply for a job at his company. i looked at the description, and it sounds like my dream job. i looked the company up on glassdoor, and the company sounds like my dream company. so i applied, my friend stuck his neck out to recommend me, i interviewed, and i got the job. i'm taking care of the paperwork this week, and i start on monday. that's the good part.  now, the bad part: i'm openly transgender, i live in texas, and my new job is in texas, too. recently, our lieutenant governor has promised to ram an anti-transgender bathroom bill through the state legislature (and the lt. gov. has extremely strong powers over the state legislature, so he absolutely can do this if he wants), and the next session will be in the first half of next year. if that bill passes, i'm gone. i'll put in my notice at my job, break my lease, pack my things, and move to a blue state (probably to socal, but that's still up in the air).  basically... am i doing the right thing accepting this job if i know there's a very good possibility i'll have to quit in less than a year? it's my dream job, and i really, *really*, ***really*** don't want to have to leave, but i cannot live in any state with a transphobic bathroom law. but it feels almost dishonest to accept a permanent position knowing that i'll probably have to leave it so soon. i will, however, do my job to the absolute best of my ability and act as if i intend to stay at this company for life, because there's a chance the bathroom bill *won't* pass, and i definitely intend to stay at this company for as long as humanly possible if it doesn't.  i'm also worried about hurting my friend, since he stuck his neck out to get me this job. this is a guy who's told me that i'm like a sister to him, and the feeling is mutual (that is, he's like a brother to me... i'm fairly sure he's not trans). i'm not sure how much my friend is aware of my intentions to move, either. i mentioned it to him last month (not in the context of a job hunt, just venting to a friend about possibly being forced to evacuate my hometown), around the time he suggested i apply at his company, but he just kind of blew it off with ""that bill will never pass"", and i don't think he put two and two together. of course, he's when i told him that, he also said that he's confident bernie sanders will become president and nullify the law, so i know that his expectations of political events are unrealistic (i love him like a brother... i just think his head is in the clouds sometimes). and i made a post on facebook last month soliciting ideas for places to move to, which i don't think he even noticed. i can't tell if he's aware i might have to bail under a year in and simply accepts it, or if he just hasn't realized it yet and will be hurt when he finds out. honestly, part of the reason i made a throwaway instead of using my main is because he's a redditor, my main is linked to my real-life identity, and i don't want him reading this post and knowing i was the one who made it.  what do all of you think?"

[this wolfram alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=moving+from+st+louis+to+san+francisco+salary+$42,500&lk=3) shows about how much more it costs to live in one place vs another. i'm not too seasoned on col calculations, but wolfram alpha was listed before hand. another benchmark that might be more specific is how much the average house price in one neighborhood is compared to another. doing two searches on zillow or any other real estate website should give good results.  * relocation. hiring managers have budget they use to hire people, but money allocated from the relocation budget is separate. if you need to move houses, break a lease, buy a car, set up in a new area, take care of inconveniences that people who are in the area don't have to deal with, etc.  * competing offer. a competing offer is amazing for leverage, especially if it's from a competitor. say there are three companies: a, b, and c. all three three offers are $10. if you like a the best, and a and b are competitors, bringing up b's offer would do you better, since company a is not only acquiring talent but also decreasing the talent pool b has to chose from.  * state income tax. i've not read about this before, but it might give you a one-up. since employers understand that states that portion of salary taken up by income tax will not be able to directly support one's cost of living. say a company sets the baseline for pay at $10, but the state where your takes $1 for taxes whereas the state where the hq for the company is doesn't take any money in the form of taxes. in this case it's reasonable to ask for a little bit more money.  and all of these factors go into compensation, which takes many forms. here is a brief list i've taken from an article [linked](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation-c46bb9bc7dea#.u3cljsfjz) on here many times : salary, signing bonuses, stock, year-end or performance bonuses, commuter benefits, relocation expenses, equipment, an educational stipend, a childcare stipend, extra vacation time, a later start date, getting a dedicated hour a day to work out or study or meditate or play solitaire.  again, please contribute your own ideas below"

how do i avoid people (or companies with people) like this,6r1fwm,blank,idontwanttomsft,19,1501672455.0,"this letter was floating around the intern group and i was very annoyed because it makes all of the interns seem like entitled twats. how do i avoid places with people like this (who wrote the letter).  dear dr. gwen houston, chief diversity & inclusion officer at microsoft, i hope this email finds you well. my name is xxxxxx, and i write this email in behalf of the summer 2017 interns at microsoft. we write this email to let you know what we think about microsoft’s policies regarding diversity and inclusion, what microsoft is doing well, what it is failing at, and how it can do better. microsoft is doing a much better job at promoting diversity and inclusion than any other big company out there. the impression i get is that microsoft is a mature company and behaves like an adult. we believe microsoft really wants to be committed to diversity, that it has exerted a tremendous amount of effort in being ethical, and that it can be the true leader of marrow-deep diversity in tech, the leader that shows the travis kalanicks of the world what they are doing wrong and how they can do better. but it is not that leader yet. as of now, it is hard for us to discern how much of microsoft’s diversity efforts are marketing tactics, and how much are sincere. while we would very much like to believe that they are sincere – and there is a lot that indicates that they are – there is a smorgasbord of small things, peppered and doused throughout the company, that stick out like sore thumbs and make us doubtful about microsoft’s true commitment to diversity. here are some company-wide examples, just so you can get a feel of what we’re talking about. 1. during satya’s intern q&a on july 27 th (yesterday), an engineering intern made a piercing point about the hypocrisy of the explorer program. she noted that, as a rising junior, she could have applied for a regular internship, but, being an underrepresented minority, was specifically sought out and encouraged by recruiters to apply for the explore internship. as a result, she discovered that she received about half the pay of regular interns despite their shared education history and the requisite skill set. 2. also during the q&a, there was a big screen at the stage magnifying satya and occasionally showing the faces of interns in the group. a friend who was wearing a hijab was shown on this screen no less than three times. i don’t make judgments about the cameraman’s intentions, but the outcome was that several of us felt our friend, as a “token minority”, was being used for marketing, so microsoft can say, “look how diverse we are!” i also saw microsoft officials going around the room to pick out “diverse people”, frequently female and/or african american, to come up and sit on reserved seats on the front, so that they would be better viewed by the camera. 3. on monday, july 17 th , wdg held an intern summer event at marymoor park. as part of the event, interns were divided into teams to solve challenges together. while this game style is a common intern activity, the guise it took was insensitive: teams become tribes​ to compete with other teams in survivor style challenges and castaway themed activities… the group will be divided into tribes​ and will have an opportunity to “theme” themselves with tribal markings and create a custom tribe flag​… in the wake of the washington redskins controversy, as well as the long and ongoing history of the mistreatment of native americans, some of us thought this game was not inclusive and not respectful. a number of us chose to sit out of the game. and here are some personal examples. 4. xxxxxx as a south korean national, i have been asked several ignorant questions about my heritage throughout my internship. one legal representative spelled my name as *off by 2 letters* in an official correspondence. and while i see people of my race represented well in lower and middle rank positions, i notice how they drastically thin out in the higher rank positions. 5. your example here: 6. your example here: … … … despite all these problems, i still have hope that microsoft can be the diversity leader that the tech world needs. microsoft is the unique company that successfully underwent a full cultural shift under satya, a leader who has shown remarkable humility, who, after saying that women who demand equal pay should just wait for the system to change, genuinely learned from the lesson and has worked tirelessly to diminish this gap. two weeks ago, i had a great meeting with daryl welsh, director of engineering at our organization, where i brought up some of these issues, and told him i was drafting this email. he encouraged me to send it, which i appreciated. he noted that initially, when microsoft’s cultural shift was underway, employees had to attend offline workshops lasting three to four days. i was surprised at how short these workshops were considering the drastic shift that resulted within microsoft’s internal culture; if three days is enough to accomplish what it did, what could be done over longer timespans? and that is our proposal: offline workshops lasting not three, four days but three, four months. in effect, classes, led by passionate ethnic studies scholars, with hundreds of pages of assigned readings and sincere debates, for full-timers and interns alike. for people who do not want such a big commitment yet, a speaker series from renowned authors and scholars, just like msr’s speaker series, but talking instead about systemic racism, colonialism, and unconscious biases. in other words, a push towards not superficial but deep diversity, a push with microsoft’s full weight, to really challenge the status quo, to change long-seated stereotypes and facilitate dialogue. we understand that this could be a big commitment, and at times can be even a sticky political issue. but there is no easy, superficial cure for racism. hiring minority students gets only so far when racism and culture are taboo topics to discuss. we believe that if microsoft leads a company-wide initiative, offering long-term offline workshops to talk about racism, colonialism, and unconscious biases, the domain of discourse will significantly expand, and employees, whether enrolled in the workshops or not, will feel more comfortable discussing such topics. this, in turn, will create a truly diverse culture in microsoft, and, i believe, it will be a significant factor in attracting new talent. i, for one, will choose a company sincerely committed to diversity over any competing offer, because i care more about the climate in which i work more than anything. us millennials are sick of superficial diversity, as it has been hoisted on us our entire lives, and want genuinely to be able to empathize with diverse cultures – now if only we had the knowledge to do so! thank you for taking the time to read this email, and i hope you will consider our proposal. i would love to have a meeting with you to talk further, and come up with more concrete plans. already a few scholars i know come to mind who would love to work here. we hope for a near future where this following mission statement is a bit less empty, where it deeply resonates with the soul of every single person at microsoft. diversity and inclusion: we don’t just value differences, we seek them out. we invite them in. microsoft is a place where employees can be who they are. we value diverse perspectives. and as a result, we have better ideas, better products and happier customers.

would it be worth it for me to move to the west coast?,en0rqi,blank,lindburger_,91,1578735376.0,"i'm a 29f java developer with a masters degree in computer science. i've been working for about 5 years now and live in a mid-sized city on the east coast. i just got a new job and i expect that if i stay with the same company for the next 3 years or so my salary should get to around 150k (base + annual bonus), not taking promotions into account. i'm mainly a backend developer but i'm also decent at building stuff with angular. going forward that's what i want my career to look like - equal parts back and front end development.  my life in my current city is pretty great. i own a 2-bedroom condo in the city, bought my car with cash, save and invest a good 40-45% of my paycheck and just in general don't ever feel a shortage of money. even though i get to work on interesting projects, i rarely have to work more than 40 hours a week and have my evenings and weekends free to do my own stuff and hang out with friends. work is a quick 20-minute train ride away and i don't even have to pay for it out of pocket. decent benefits as well.  but lately i can't help think that i'm missing out by not being on the west coast. i've been to california a few times and tbh i've never really liked any of the cities i've visited. sfo is too cold (for me) and expensive. la, san diego and everything in between is charmless and boring, and expensive. rural california is beautiful but there's no jobs there as far as i'm aware. seattle is beautiful as well but again expensive and so far removed from the rest of the country. then there's all the stuff that i read about how the silicon valley culture is so competitive, cutthroat and basically everyone is always working long hours and and it's just a dick-measuring contest to see who makes the most money. plus the cost of living is so high so everyone lives far away from work and has a terrible commute. it's all anecdotal so i don't know how much of it is really true.  here's the thing though - i love money. it's why i moved to this country. but i also love my life here on the east coast. if i decided to move to ca or wa some time in the next few years, would i be making enough money to justify giving up my life here? would i be able to afford a house, car, savings, all that jazz, living on the west coast? while still having enough of a work-life balance?  **tl;dr** is it worth it for a java dev to move to the west coast for the pay increase and would i be able to maintain the same quality of life there as i have here on the east coast?"

"the good, bad, and the ugly of web dev coding bootcamps - in depth explanation",doixms,blank,that_90s_guy,191,1572341460.0,"hi reddit!  so, i often get a large number of bootcamp related questions directly to my inbox, and decided to instead of answering every single one of them, to write an article summarizing my experience as a bootcamp mentor across various programs for +3 years, and someone who's been in the industry for +5 years now and interviews candidates on a daily basis. i was recommended by a redditor to post my article on r/cscareerquestions. i decided to just post the markdown content as my goal isn't to promote my personal blog and it's instead to help people. hope it helps some of you!  on to the article!  # the good, bad, and the ugly of web dev coding bootcamps.  not all bootcamps are created equal.  so…**coding bootcamps**. calling them a controversial way to get into coding as a career path is nothing short of an understatement. right? some people love them, some hate them. some think of them as little more than a quick cash grab to ride the influx of developer roles. plus, it would explain why the most often received question i get in my inbox is:  # what do you think about <insert bootcamp name? do you think it’s worth it?  sadly, there is no short answer 🙁 so, in an effort to help all these people on the edge of considering a coding bootcamp…i’ve decided to write this article summing up my experiences teaching at bootcamps, seeing students rise and fail, lessons learned, and any tips and advice i’d give to anyone considering a coding bootcamp.  ## the good ✅  the thing coding bootcamps excel at the most, is at providing **direction**. learning how to code can be a daunting, overwhelming task at times. there is so much you need to know, and so much important stuff you can’t possibly know that you don’t know. bootcamps make this easier by providing a curated learning path.  the other fantastic thing about bootcamps, is the **community** that often comes along with it. learning on your own and getting stuck can often be a deeply demoralizing experience. one that changes drastically once you have a whole community behind your back.  there’s also the **portfolio **of projects aspect. most bootcamps have a roadmap that lets you end with multiple portfolio projects by the time you graduate. this is the key to landing a full time job with no experience, and probably the hardest part of learning on your own. as you will probably be faced with the common “what do i build?” type of question and end up building nothing.  for the ones that offer it, there’s also the invaluable **career services** option. for those unfamiliar, this is basically a service for course graduates that helps you find a job, polish your curriculum and social media, and basically does its best to set you up for success. not too bad!  lastly, there’s the **1:1** **support** which is invaluable as a beginner coder. this is one the biggest things i envy the most as someone who had to learn coding pretty much from scratch (i am not a cs graduate). it’s an incredibly frustrating experience getting stuck for days at a time, only to finally arrive at a random meetup and have a stranger point out a single line of code is to blame. i would not have had to go through so much frustration if i had a 1:1 mentor back in the day.  ## the bad ❌  there are a **lot **of **bad** coding bootcamps. i cannot understate this enough. at least in my area, i’ve seen an increasingly large amount of *cheap*, online coding bootcamps. these are made by people who are only out there to cash in the public interest to learn coding, but don’t really care about making you employable. and you can quickly figure this out by just looking at their curriculum.  some bootcamps barely go into js/css/html fundamentals, and then rush you into a react/angular/vue app and call it a day. this will **not **land you a job. the market is **saturated** with people who know how build a hello world react app but lack the pillars that really make up a developer. training a person properly takes time, and money. this of course means that a good bootcamp will not be cheap. i’m sorry if that’s not something you were hoping to hear 🙁  the second thing you need to know before even considering a job in coding, is that you need to make sure you ❤️ this line of work. nobody really ever tells you that a life in coding, is basically a career where you can never stop learning. and one where sometimes you’ll have to sacrifice free time to stay up to date to current trends in technology if you wish to either stay relevant, or go up the professional ladder. i’ve met a lot of people who joined bootcamps, but were not prepared for the amount of time they had to sacrifice to complete it.  lastly, **time**. due to the challenging nature of a lot of coding bootcamps, it is important you consider the need of having to put in more hours into the course. this is by far the biggest thing i see catching people off guard. what this means, is that if the bootcamp you are considering asks you for 20 hours a week to complete, be prepared to spend up to 40 hours a week when the going gets tough. if this is impossible to you, i would say find another one with a smaller time commitment that fits better in your time schedule.  ## the ugly 💩  first, and possibly the most controversial topic on this article:  # you** need** to know how to code **before **joining a coding bootcamp.  i know what you are all thinking. isn’t that *why* you would join a coding bootcamp? well, not exactly. the thing about learning how to code from scratch, is that quite frankly…it’s **hard**. not to mention every person learns differently both in technique, and at a different pace. this in turn, makes it extremely hard to design course material. specially when you have to **predict **the specific amount of time it takes to complete, how easy/hard it will be to most people.  which results in bootcamps that are either:  * *easy and a breeze to complete*, but yielding almost no value to students in terms of employability. meaning you’ll probably have to pay for another course/bootcamp to even be considered for most programing jobs.  * *hard and challenging*, but with high student drop out rates due to the challenging nature of the course. of course, this also means that should you not complete the course, you will not be getting a refund.  these two stereotypes are the reason why even reputable bootcamps always have their fair share of complaints. such as: the course was too easy, i couldn’t find a job after graduating, or that the course was so hard i always felt like i was drowning and received no help.  having said that, as you can probably imagine, only the hard/challenging ones will give you your money’s worth when it comes to becoming a job ready software engineer. however, in order to highly increase your chances of graduating, my recommendation is that you** learn how to code *before* joining a coding bootcamp.**  in summary: does this mean there are no good bootcamps? no! there are fantastic bootcamps out there. however, like buying a house or a car, you should do your own research before settling on which one to pick. and i can definitely vouch to there being fantastic coding bootcamps. you just need to find them.  ## that’s all folks!  do i hate bootcamps? of course not! i work for one after all 😁 at least at the time of writing this article. still, i’ve received so many messages lately about bootcamps, i felt writing a piece on this was the right step to help people. hopefully you can pick up the right bootcamp, or if it proves too expensive, maybe hire a private mentor? 👀  until next time! 👋 *adios*!"

choosing between two junior roles in london,3vwtd4,blank,londoncscareer,2,1449596375.0,"hello,  i have received 2 offers for .net developer roles in london, and i am having trouble deciding which offer to take.  they're both equal pay. one is working for a construction consulting company in the city. their core business is consulting for the construction industry, however they also have a software division which has become pretty successful and spawned a whole new company on its own. in this role, i would be the 5th developer on the team (all similar ages), working in a very modern office, doing backend, web, and mobile development in xamarin. lots of developers for me to learn from, less pressure, happier working environment, and more people my age.  the other company is a very small fintech company in west london. the company is essentially the 3 directors, who are very experienced and successful, ~40+ years old each. i would be employee #7, developer #2. i feel i would have to work hard here, but the potential rewards are higher. this company also has the advantage of being in finance, which is more difficult to break into later on in your career. this role is c#, asp.net.  i'm leaning towards the fintech company, mainly because of the industry (i have an interest in finance, have interned at jpmc). the construction company ""really want me"" and the recruiter is asking me ""what will it take for you to accept the offer? how much will they have to offer you?"".  help, /r/cscareerquestions.  inb4 downvotes since this post isn't about sv google internships."

(throwaway because i’m a moderator of a couple of subs in a completely orthogonal domain (pornography) and i don’t want this post to affect that image. yes, porn. now get over it and read this one, which is no less exciting!)  **my profile:**  location: texas  degree: bachelors in electronics engineering from a top 100 college in us. never done algorithms/ds in college.  work: software (i got into programming when in college and then a friend of mine hired me to do a little project for her. it rolled from there)  experience: coming up to 11 years, mostly full-stack work in python and java. i'm old.  current workplace: a small company you have never heard of  total compensation: $100k approx. (yes, that is sufficient to live in texas in your own house!)  goal: get into one of the top tier companies as a software engineer. i was okay to move to bay area to get that brand i never had on the resume. not sure why i wanted a brand; i just wanted it.  job search started: november 2018. i thought i will prepare during the few holiday weeks and apply when the new year starts. boy was i wrong.  **first attempt**  practice in nov and dec 2018: about 50 problems on leetcode, mostly easy, some medium. some mock interviews with friends.  companies interviewed at in jan 2019: apple, amazon, ebay, atlassian, walmart labs, microsoft (i got all interviews via friends).  i failed all of them. like all. every one of them. some on phone, some later. walmart labs, atlassian were the two where i went onsite and failed.  there is probably nothing more depressing to realize that you’ve spent 9 years and are still not good enough for a tier-1 company. i was that guy.  i was about to give up, when my girlfriend encouraged me to prepare even more and try again. i thought she was being ridiculous - who prepares for interviews at all? but after a few months of her nudging me, a lot o beers, porn and frustration, i figured i should at least try once again.  **second attempt**  practice from april 2019 through august 2019: nearly 250 carefully curated problems in algos and systems design, done in a proper way with repetitions etc. i also found and paid for a coaching class to help me keep pace and support me.  companies interviewed at (approximately in order) in july and august 2019:  &#x200b;  * microsoft (a different org from last time). == offer! didn’t take it because it was lower than other offers * amazon alexa team (they don’t have a moratorium) == didn’t make it again. the phone screen had a question too specific in a domain i have never worked in (embedded software). i thought alexa was more of a distributed system behind the scene but looks like that part is more or less an application on top of aws. interesting parts are in hardware and ml. * linkedin == senior engineer offer! they are separate from microsoft even today. this was a harder interview than i had expected. i got a dp problem, a graph problem, a tree problem, and two systems design questions. * facebook == l5 offer! i had told them that i have an li offer, so they moved fast. one of the hardest interviews i had. one of the interviewers asked me 3 coding questions in one interview! three! questions weren’t hard, but they expected me to code fast. i feel that speed was very unrealistic to expect, but hey it’s an interview - what can you say? they also asked systems design and behavioral questions. trees and graphs were popular here too. * google == l5 offer! i started this one before facebook, but the offer came thru only later. google is painfully slow. they took what felt like forever, in scheduling the interview, getting to the hc, in team matching, compensation and then closing. got two dp questions. two!  new compensation: $310k total. 165k base, 25k (15%) yearly bonus and rest in equity. 5k sign-on bonus (after negotiation), which i’m not counting. fb and linkedin came close, but i really wanted google.  **advice for fellow seekers**  &#x200b;  1. don’t hate the process. it’s not in your hands to change it and often not in your interviewers’ hands either. embrace it. if you want to change it, then get inside the system first and then change it. wish me luck. 2. practice the right set of problems. don’t just blindly grind leetcode. it will take you forever, even if you can keep motivation. 3. work on your communication skills. i thought i communicated well, but only when i was forced to work on it with the coach, that i realized mine was nowhere near acceptable quality. 4. repeat the problems you’ve done again. yes, repeat. just write code again. there is some sort of magic there, which improves your retention and recall of other newer problems too. 5. know that getting and setting up interviews is as much work as actually appearing for them. i mostly got them through friends and connections i found on linkedin. also, there is just no good way to take time off of work and not raise suspicions. in my case, i had to travel which made it worse. i tried to bundle as many interviews as i could, including phone-screens. though one advantage of being in texas was the timezone difference. it’s lunch time when the day is starting on west coast, so phone screens were slightly easier to schedule. 6. you will feel like giving up. a lot of times. don’t. just don’t. i had a group of (remote) people in the coaching class which helped me keep motivation. find your friends. or your enemies. whatever floats your boat to get you off your butt to get back and work. 7. do mock interviews with people who know how to give feedback. find whatever means necessary to find such people. don’t just do them with other fellow seekers. 8. not all roles at top tier companies are created equal. i wanted to crack into the coveted se role which is usually the highest paid and i could, but it was hard and took me a while. given that only brand was my goal, i could have just considered other discounted roles at same companies e.g. frontend engineering, solutions engineering, support engineering, project management etc. pay is going to be less than se in these roles, but they are a bit easier to get in.  **tl;dr:** practice pays. start early. keep on going. i realize that preparing to get into top tier companies is the single most impactful thing i have done for my future. except porn, of course ;-)"

is it easier to find a fully remote role or to freelance?,epg0hv,blank,BigMagicTulip,2,1579188116.0,"front-end developer, about 1.5 work experience, currently working as a front-end developer in a eastern european country.  during this time the hardest part for me was having to work in an office environment. sure there are other things i dislike (working on boring tech / codebase, the whole agile working and meetings,. etc), but on the whole i had a lot of flexibility and the pay is more than decent given the cost of living here.   not gonna go into much details (see my post history for more), but i just am unable to do barely any work done due to distractions and my inability to focus and ignore those. it's not something that can be fixed with putting your headphones on and blasting music or exercise and all that (i've tried most of the common suggestions i've found while trying to address it).  guess it kind of sucks, but working in an environment where i can't do my work is deeply frustrating and is kind of making me miserable right now. so the alternative to this would be either fully remote work or going into freelancing.  i know the most useful route into going remote would be to start at a company and then going remote after a while, but that implies that i was going to work hard and become good enough to warrant that change, and given my inability to properly work in an office environment that kind of makes it a no-go option.   now my question is, would it be easier for me to find a remote position or go into freelancing? given my experience, to me they both kind of seem to be equally hard in terms of finding a role versus finding enough clients as a freelancer.

"have you ever wondered what the hiring process was 20 years ago compared to today? probably not, but i'll tell you anyway.",brjexy,blank,SomeGuyInSanJoseCa,298,1558521862.0,"i have searched tech jobs twice in my life.  once as a new grad in 1999, and just now.  for those that are just curious, or for those that are older and am curious about the current recruitment process, let me explain what i saw.  1999:  jobs were super easy to get.  it was a weird time when non-tech folks were in charge of tech folks.  also, the amount of technology used wasn't as massive and varied as it is now.  no one asked for 12 years of python experience with computer vision with jenkins within a docker container or whatever because that shit didn't exist back then.  it was a much simpler time.  it was kind of development of system admin as the major pillars back then.   this meant that often times, it was behavioral and simple questions, as many hiring managers were just general people managers and not engineering managers.    in terms of tech questioning, whiteboarding of useless problems was the only way to test really.  but it wasn't that complicated.  and if you were decent, and communicated well, you got the job.  i think i ended up with 10 offers out of 10 second round interviews (i got rejected by one, but another one gave me two offers).  but since i just finished undergrad, silly algo / data structure problems were all i knew, it was super easy for me.  sure, the first time i saw vi i was scared and had to ask a colleague what this was, but i could traverse a graph on whiteboard like a motherfucker.  recruiting was also different.  it was put your resume in a resume database and kind of wait.  job fairs were the best way to do that.  the massive recruiting teams that large employers have now were definitely not at today's scale. this meant that you got fewer requests for jobs, but you also weren't competing against 100 other people for that one position.  essentially, if you were contacted, there was a much better chance you were getting the job due to limited hr resources.  it saved a lot of time.  also, there were no tiered awesome companies with great pay.  it was pretty standard for a new grad.  i got $62k and a few piddly stock options at the time at the most awesome company ever, a company that would never run out of ideas and dominate the industry forever.  that company was sun microsystems.  so, yeah, don't count on me for any gambling advice.  pretty much ever company was the within $10k of that, with varying degrees of stock options.   all that being said, the fallout of the dot-com bust (one year later) was dramatic.  all those people who were hired with limited credentials and skills suddenly got canned and things got tight.  suddenly, knowing html didn't make you a coder anymore.  i know a lot of people who were plain screwed.  there were no bootcamps back then, but equivalent were the people that learned to code with the ""learn java in 21 days"" books were assed out at the end of the day.  a lot of them went it to real estate, so, yeah, you can put two and two together on what the next downturn was.   2019:  first thing first.  holy fucking shit job searches are annoying.  you need to match all these random technologies.  then, even if you have that, you have to memorize all those leetcode tricks (that's right, not skills, but tricks).  sure, i know loops and trees and the like, but dang, i didn't remember the trick to get the consecutive subset of numbers to equal a passed in sum efficiently (mine was inefficient) - so yeah, even though i matched pretty darn well with the job requirements, i did not get that coding parlor trick, so i'm out.  this was for a partner engineering position btw, which in no way shape or form would require any sort of algorithmic knowledge.   in my undergrad days, i would say i memorized 80% of those tricks out there.  today, i know about 40%.  so, i was immediately knocked out of like 60% of interviews.  i didn't realize that the leetcode monkey dance would be so prevalent.  next job search, i know what to study for - this last one i was ill-prepared.  anyway, i think most people felt the algo / data structures problems were outdated 20 years ago - but man, they are even worse now.  but knowing the trick basically got me an in as well.  so yeah, it's completely fucking random whether i impress people or not.  one company thinks i'm an idiot and nother thought i was god because of the random selection of leetcode-esqe questions.    on the opposite end - holy fucking shit does this pay well.  my. fucking. god.  5 years ago, those that got $300k were lucky to jump in the right company at the right time with the right options, were a super genius, someone who is some major thought leader, or some senior director.  now a schmuck like me can get near $300k.  this is crazy.  i joined a company for $180k in 2017 in total. compensation, and i was ecstatic.  in 2012, i think i was rightly paid at $120k or something like that.  now i just accepted an offer for $280k.  this is nice, but also a bit scary.  i've been through 2 different downturns.  what's going to happen if there's another downturn and these crazy salaries whither away?  let me put it another way.  for the early to mid 2010s, my wife and i were paid the same though she's way smarter than me.  but since she does supply chain and not tech, she's gotten about a 30% increase in pay in the last 4 years (pretty good), and my pay has roughly doubled.   i'm also amazed that some companies out there think that it is still 2015 and offer those salaries.  most non-tech companies are completely flabbergasted in terms of my desired salary.  many of them came back later with a substantial increase because they couldn't find anyone qualified, but i still had to say it wasn't enough.    recruiting is also way different.  linkedin is awesome, because i know how yakov smirnoff feels when he talks about soviet russia.  on linkedin...jobs come to you!  of course, since it is linkedin, you got to wade through all these useless intros.  it's a full time job.  i think the first week i said i was actively looking, i got 30 pings.  everyone wanted a half hour conversation.  many of them didn't bother reading my requirements.  no, i am not a front-end engineer and no i don't want to move to seattle - why do you want to talk?  many just plain ghosted me after i replied with something like, ""i am interested and i would like to know more.""  like, what did you want, me to show a picture of myself jerking off to tim cook or something or in order to get a reply back from you?  most recruiters who do talk to you basically tell you are god's gift to employers, then either say something like, you were not a match to the job i said you were a match to, or send me to another person who grills me.  it's a huge bi-polar emotional rollercoaster of validation and rejection.  i was mentally drained from all this.  like my ex-girlfriend is god of job applications or something.  also, the pillars are way different.  you don't have simple pillars like development or system admin, it gets way more fragmented.  you have devops/sre, you got web development, ml/ai/data science, and way more high level pillars.  this is cool in that you can be more sure of what you want, but not cool in that once you are in one, it takes some effort to get out.   in terms of those pillars - devops/sre is the hottest thing out there right now. i actually just got a masters in cs with a specialization in ml and some minor ml experience.  no one gives a flying fuck. but because i can spell kubernetes, i got devops / sre requests left and right (this is the job i essentially took btw)  anyway, 2019 is similar and different in many ways.  but damn, i do not want to go through this job search again.  fuck. that.  ...............  anyway, for us old farts who walked uphill both ways in the snow, i wanted to share a few tricks along the way and would totally do my job search differently.  here's what i l learned.   1) leetcode algo / data structure memorization is key.  sure, they don't know if you are older, but it's the easiest way to have age discrimination.  very few 41 year olds are going to remember what they did in college at age 20 - the perfect way to filter out the gray hairs and those with a family.  2) i always ask for salary.  weed out those that say, ""it depends.""  depends on what?  my experience?  the exact same experience that you can see on linkedin as we are talking right now?  3) ask a question that only a hiring manager can answer.  if the recruiter can't do that, the recruiter is just gathering resumes and has no idea if you ""perfect for the job"" as he or she states.  time is limited with the relentless amount of pings you'll get - this is a great way to make sure that they are serious about you being a candidate.  4) ensure that you are the only person interviewing for that position if possible.  i got a semi-offer from a company because they loved me, and wanted me to wait for another rec to open, but they hired someone with azure experience and explicitly saying azure experience is not a requirement.  i wasn't going to wait and it was a complete waste of my time.  i found that there are companies that have like 5 people interview for one position, and those that interview one at a time and will fill it if you are good.  the latter is the key because you are the only variable.  ask for flexibility in terms of interviewing.  if they are interviewing a whole bunch of candidates, they want you in a 3 day window.  if they are just checking you out exclusively, they'll be really flexible.  ...............  anyway, enough my pointless rant.  now you little fucking whippersnappers can get off my lawn!"
opportunities in embedded systems/iot for new grads,emeuvo,blank,angryroombaba,1,1578628155.0,"i'm currently enrolled in a graduate cs program and i have several different options of where to focus my coursework on. they are not official specializations offered by the program but the way i see it, the options that seem most appealing to me currently are:      (1) focus on machine learning/ai-related courses with electives such as computer vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, etc.    (2) focus on embedded systems/networks/distributed computing courses.     i have industry experience in neither of these fields, but i have completed small personal projects related to both and find that both are equally interesting to me. machine learning is obviously one of the hottest skills to have right now with many large tech companies paying a premium for people with these skills (from personal observations/anecdotes, might be wrong about this point), but i also find the stuff that iiot companies such as samsara and flexport are doing also very interesting.      my question is for those who have worked at companies or on teams doing iot/embedded systems-related stuff. i understand experiences could vary drastically depending on the company and position but in general:      (1) what are some of the common (technical/non-technical) problems that you find yourself having to solve on a regular basis and do you find solving these problems satisfying?   (2) what is the hiring outlook looking like for those with no experience (but possibly a small portfolio of personal projects) looking to break into the field?"

"already 15k in debt, is the degree an additional 40k? also a story in what not to do for a startup.",dhkeir,blank,WishIWasOnACatamaran,8,1571049536.0,"tl;dr: started working in it as a cs student. joined a shitty startup setting me back a year in development skill and my degree, already have 15k of debt and 40k more scares the shit out of me, but my other options scare me just as much, need advice.  a bit of background first:  i've been in school since 2016. fall 2017, i took an it internship (after working in it for a year at that point in student-worker role for my university) that pushed 35 hours a week, and since i'm an early 20s person, i valued also having a life. you know, hanging out with friends, going on small cheap trips, concerts, etc. i decided that to have that balance, i stepped down to a part-time student. after that internship, i ended up taking a role with a startup for the experience to do code. well, turns out coding exercises and ebooks do not equal being able to pull the weight as 1 of 2 developers on the team. one week i would be asked to do website work, the next programming electronics for our technology, the third database, and the fourth our ceo would be lost as to why i wasn't keeping up with the website. this was all brand new technology and brand new languages, but i was just so eager to try it all out. eventually, he decided that i had incredible business acumen, and wanted me to focus on both business work and tech work. great i thought, i get exposure to tech and get to use my business acumen (my prior background and career path before i found passion in tech). soon he began telling me to prioritize the business work, but just for now he kept saying. well, as i'm sure plenty of you may guess, this became my primary role. especially after a particular week he wanted the entire website complete out of the blue for a potential investor (of which i also had to prep market research and ir paperwork). after that didn't meet his standards, he put me solely on business. this resulted in us getting thousands of dollars in investment (giving us millions in valuation, landed us some techcrunch recognition even), and starting a side project that would become the sole purpose of the company. this also put the nail in the coffin on me doing anything tech related. i basically assumed the entire business role for the company. i hated it so much. it discouraged me from doing any programming. keep in mind, i am getting no pay, and an undisclosed (to me and only me) amount of ""ownership"" in the company. i had a part-time job as a computer tech to pay my bills, but between that and school, i just couldn't handle all 3. since i poured myself into this role, i decided to essentially take a whole year off from school. after completing 37.5% of my degree. at 22 years old. eventually the ceo became so strap for cash, he poured everything into trying to get clients for a side technology that was on par at best with the rest of the market, but on the higher end cost-wise, and completely removing focus from the tech that did make us special. i completely disagreed with this decision, but he refused to find another job for himself to support himself while building this company. i realized i could not afford to spend more time on this sinking ship, especially since i was not making literally any money, and decided to up and leave one day. i tried to find dev jobs in my area, but had little to nothing to show project-wise, and frankly had lost some fundamental knowledge. the best offer i got was an internship for 66% of my hourly wage at half the hours. also, due to contract reasons, i could not do that and my computer tech job at the same time. i wanted to get back into school, get back into programming, and get my life back on track.  here i am 7 months later. i have been promoted to full-time at my computer tech job (with a raise and bonus!). this company has a corporate side that my manager has made clear he will get me in the door for. they have every role anybody could dream of doing that has any interest in cs or it. however, i am taking follow-up courses to classes i haven't taken or touched in 2.5 years. i was behind going in, and am ever further behind now. i don't really have a social life at this point because i am either tired or trying to relearn material from years ago, letalone shit out something even close to what we are covering now. at this pace, if i pass every class, i will graduate in 5 years with an additional 40k of student loan debt (less if i get as or bs due to education reimbursement from my employer, but that would be a godsend given where i am currently at with these courses). i want to start focusing on my career and focusing specifically on that. my courses don't touch on anything related to these subject, except occasionally on a theoretical level or a math level.   i feel very stuck, and personally know nobody in a similar situation. i know people work multiple jobs and attend school full-time and get all a's, but frankly that blows my damn mind. i'd be happy doing anything from sysadmin work to ios development at this point, but just don't know what the right path is. i am trying to meet with tutors on the 2 days i have off (the days i have multiple classes and don't allow for a 9 hour shift to be schedule), but also have errands to run and chores to do. i want to accomplish my goals, but i don't want to burn myself into the ground in the process. i still feel the same discouragement i felt failing on tech stuff in the startup, but know i really shouldn't blame myself. if given an opportunity on the corporate side, i don't want to fuck it up. they don't require a college degree necessarily, but i will be expected to show up and perform. i may have an opportunity with the company that i did that internship for, but it would pretty much lock me there 8-5 mon-fri (plus weekends and ot in the spring, for reasons) for the next 5-10 years. it'd be great on my resume and i'd get a decent amount of freedom in what i do, but it's mostly going to be it work. it basically will lock me in it for a long while, but without the contractual obligation to code freely for myself in my free time.  i appreciate if you made it this far in my post, and doubly so if you have any advice. focusing on any direction feels like a complete gamble, and to be honest i am just scared and stressed. i don't mean for this to be a sap story, and if anything a cautionary tale to those younger than myself. especially those who have to take unconventional routes in life, because you're just that type of person. thanks again guys, this is easily one of the most supportive subs on this website."
thinking about moving to software dev from devops engineer,dzqeq8,blank,kjiroppokre,2,1574400940.0,"right now i'm a devops engineer making $150k. 100% remote, working 40 hours a week.  however, this seems like the cap of this career path. i'm not exactly sure where i can go from here. i've been a sysadmin / devops engineer for seven years now, and of the past five jobs that i've had, there is zero opportunity for advancement within a company. my performance reviews have never been anything other than glowing, but then my raise is either nothing or an insultingly low 2% or similar. (usually prompting me to look for work elsewhere, and finding something paying 10k more)  i've been pretty comfortable at my current job for the past two years, but i think it's time to move on.  i'm wondering if i should try and transition into a software dev career path. i have years of professional experience with python and bash, and some minor experience with java and ruby. personally though, i have about 15 years of experience with x86 asm, c, and c++, just from personal projects. i've talked to some sr java devs that make around $250k and have reasonable (40-50 hr) work weeks, but i don't know if i would be starting over from square one salary wise if i started applying to software dev positions.  when i was a teenager i had some jobs working with c and fortran, although they paid absolute garbage, i was a kid and didn't know how much to ask for, it was for a local university anyway. but in this vein, i would be open to working with some more esoteric languages as i find this sort of work quite interesting. ie, any sort of legacy systems, asm, fortran, etc.  ideally, i'm envisioning something like a mid to sr level c++ or python dev starting at around 160k, then climbing the salary ladder from there. is that reasonable?  what would you advise for my career here?  i'm equally happy doing sysadmin work or software dev, but of course i've never really done software dev professionally."
struggling with internship decision...,dn2myy,blank,rubicon7653,2,1572061278.0,"hi all,  i’m kind of struggling with my decision about my internship for next summer and was just wondering what you think about it, or what you would do in my situation.  for some background, i am a second year computer science student, but i am graduating in may 2021, so i am especially trying to get a good internship this year either to get a full time return offer where i intern or to set me up better for full time interviews at big target companies. i did not intern last summer, so it is crucial that i get something this summer.   now here’s the actual situation. my internship search has been going better than i thought so far. having no prior internships, i had expected little to nothing, but i’ve been interviewing with ~10-15 places and i have offers from 2 already. one offer is one that i almost surely won’t take, however the other offer is from a place i really like—the culture seems great, i think i would like the work i do, and the pay/location is decent. they aren’t a big name or prestigious, but it wouldn’t matter for a full-time search if i ultimately wanted to return there anyways. however this offer has a deadline of november 1st.   i am basically torn on whether to accept this offer that expires nov. 1st or to risk it and go for something better. i am in the final interview stage for 3 companies right now, and still interviewing with many others (including big n), so i probably won’t end up without an internship, but i can’t say for sure that i will be able to find a better offer than what i have now. i know i would prefer a big n offer for sure, but that’s still up in the air completely (interviews still coming up with amazon and g). also, i know i would like one of the offers from a company i’m in the final stages with equally, but final interview doesn’t mean guaranteed offer. basically, if i had all the offers now i would prefer them in order of big n  company a = company b  the rest, where company a is the company i have an offer with.  i feel pretty good about all my interviews coming up, and i feel like i know my data structures and algorithms very well, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush...  accepting and reneging if i get a better offer is an option, but i like the company and wouldn’t want to burn any future bridges by accepting without 100% committing to work there. plus, my university says they dish out serious consequences for reneging on an offer, and this company has a good relationship with my university.  if you followed my rambling the whole way through, thank you. what would you do? would you accept the sure offer that’s good, but not great? or would you go for a great offer (and hope you still have a good offer to fall back on)?  **tl;dr** : i have a good offer from a place i like but it expires soon. if i decline the offer, i have final interviews with places i think would have equal or probably marginally worse offers, but i would also have a chance at better offers. do i play it safe or do i go for something better?"
what do software engineers think about designers?,cc65xc,blank,custardthebun,41,1562934687.0,"i'm very early on in my career and am currently a ux designer at a large tech company.   personally, i can't see myself as a swe, but i feel like software engineers have a lot of clout. maybe it has to do with me being located in silicon valley, but it seems software engineering is glorified nowadays, like if you're a swe you're automatically the smartest person in the room. not to mention you guys have amazing pay.  my question is: is it just inferiority complex speaking since i've given swe a try and greatly disliked it and now respect people that can do something i can't? what's your attitude toward designers? do you see us at an equal playing field, or do you deep down feel superior?"
"why leetcode is a thing, and why you (probably) shouldn’t mind it as much as you do",a2aguz,blank,belldozer95,296,1543755160.0,"in my two years of keeping tabs on r/cscareerquestions, i’ve seen hundreds of threads debating the merits of leetcode style interviewing. there’s been a lot of insightful debate on the subject, but i’ve also seen a lot of people who have fundamental misunderstandings about why exactly this style of interviewing even exists. so, here i’m going to attempt to offer a thorough explanation of why leetcode is even a thing at all, for all those out there who don't get why everyone is testing them on dynamic programming and graph theory.  &#x200b;  **why leetcode is a thing:**  the software engineering field is one of the most favorable for qualified job seekers, in general. anyone with a bachelor’s degree in a technical field who can prove they know how to code and have good social skills should have little problem obtaining a job in the field.  however, there is a very big exception to this general rule: **big name west coast companies**, otherwise known as the “big n”. these well-known companies in san francisco and seattle get way more qualified applications than they have available positions. for example, about **1 in 130** google applicants get an offer, per forbes. this number is probably slightly more favorable for software engineering positions compared to other positions at google, but you get the picture. even a very well-qualified applicant faces long odds of getting an offer.  let’s say google wants to hire 1,000 entry level software engineers, and they get 100,000 applications. there may be \~30,000 applications that are completely unqualified and easy to weed out. but after they do that, they’re still left with 70,000 applicants for 1,000 spots. most of these people will have roughly equal qualifications: about to graduate with a b.s. in computer science or something similar, 1 or 2 internships, a few small side projects.   how do you pick 1,000 winners out of a pool of 70,000 resumes that all look mostly the same? you interview them, of course. but normal behavioral interviewing is too easy, and won’t weed out nearly enough people. so another method is needed that can weed out a very large portion of the applicant pool, while still appearing fair and somewhat related to the job. enter leetcode!  make all your well-qualified applicants solve 4 hard leetcode problems. maybe 10% of them will be able to solve all of them correctly and efficiently in a short period of time, and do a good job of explaining their answers. now your pool just got narrowed from 70,000 to 7,000. it’s still a daunting task to narrow the remaining candidates down, but it’s now much more manageable.  those exact numbers are just estimates, and certainly vary from company to company, but you get the idea: google/facebook/microsoft/everyotherhotwestcoastcompany have to pick a small percentage out of a massive pile of nearly identical resumes, and leetcode serves as an effective way of weeding out a majority of the competition in a way that’s (mostly) objective and (kind of) related to the job. that’s really all there is to it.  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  **why you probably shouldn’t mind:**  if leetcode was suddenly deemed an illegal hiring practice, your chances of getting hired at your favorite “big n” company probably wouldn’t increase. these companies would still need to narrow down their massive applicant pools in a way that’s not terribly time consuming, expensive, or overly subjective. how would they do that? maybe they put more weight on gpa. maybe they put more weight on where you go to school. maybe they exclude anyone who’s not a cs major. none of those things are good indicators of who is going to be a great engineer.  there are a few ideas i can think of that would most likely do a slightly better job than leetcode:  assigning some sort of coding test centered on solving bugs in a large codebase would be one example. but it would be extremely expensive and time consuming to design and grade enough unique versions of these tests to make them free from cheating.  placing more emphasis on quality side projects would be another good tool. but taking the time to actually read through the code of thousands of personal projects and coming up with some objective way to judge whose is better seems insanely subjective and time consuming.  long story short, there’s no “right way” to pick a small percentage out of a massive pool of very similar applicants. there’s no way to magically tell which 22 year olds with minimal experience will turn into amazing engineers and which will just be good engineers. the industry has settled on leetcode. it’s bullshit, but that’s okay, because the alternatives are mostly bullshit, too.  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  **so you hate leetcode. what should you do about it?**  you have two options:  **1.**  stop applying to google/facebook/microsoft/amazon/otherhotwestcoastcompany. this is not the end of the world. there are tons of companies that you can easily get hired at without grinding hours of leetcode. they will pay you extremely well, respect you, and give you challenging work. you may not be the coolest person at your high school reunion for saying you’re a software engineer at “random midwest tech company nobody’s ever heard of”, or ""non-tech company that has extensive software needs"", but you’ll still have a much more stable and enjoyable career than most new college grads can hope for in 2018.  **2.** grind leetcode anyways. if you wanna work at to google/facebook/microsoft/amazon/otherhotwestcoastcompany, you will probably have to excel at leetcode. yes, it’s bullshit, but the alternatives are bullshit, too. at least mastering leetcode is a clearly defined, bullshit objective for you to work towards.  &#x200b;  and in conclusion, i will add one last thought: if you don't think you can enjoy a software engineering career if it's not at a ""big n"", you should probably re-evaluate whether you really like this field at all."
is front end a waste of potential if i have a degree and work experience?,cngq92,blank,FEthrowawayCSCQ,18,1565267923.0,"i'm an upper year undergrad cs coop student at the university of waterloo who will be finishing my degree within the next two years. i'm trying to figure out what area of cs i want to work in once i graduate so i have some questions.  i read on /r/cscareerquestions that front end is a fast growing field where there's a lack of people who have technical degrees or significant work experience. there's an over representation of boot camp grads and career switchers applying to these jobs. people who have strong cs and software engineering fundamentals are mostly drawn towards other areas of development, so the ones who actually choose front end are (from what i've heard) highly sought after. two of my three internships have been full stack where i liked front and back end equally. if i just consider the day to day work i have no strong preference either way, so it's appealing to me that i could get ahead in my career by choosing to focus on front end now instead of competing against everyone for the other types of work. i'm not passionate about anything like ai, ml, data science, embedded, or any of those more competitive positions so i think i can have a better career just by continuing with the path i'm on and focusing on web stuff. also i've never had any luck getting interviews that weren't web related lol  you guys make it seem good, but in real life it seems like the consensus is front end development isn't a good career path. i feel like front end developers aren't respected and make less money than any other kind of developers. this is how it's been viewed at the companies i've interned at, and what i hear from my classmates as well. front end is for people who are looking for an entry into the industry but somebody who has a degree has the potential to get a much more challenging job with more interesting problems, better pay, and more opportunities.  i understand that there's a big difference between pixel pushing html/css/jquery marketing agency tier jobs, and js heavy web applications. i'm only interested in web app front end and don't really care about things like design.  my next internship is primarily front end, and i've been working on some front end focused full stack projects recently. i've been thinking about committing to something now so that i can get a solid job for full time because my generalist approach isn't getting me anywhere but mediocre companies in canada. like i said, i don't have a strong preference either way. what i want to know is, am i handicapping myself if i decide to commit to front end? will i be pigeonholed? i can do full stack or back end and be equally as happy. i'm looking at this from a perspective of salary and career growth. like every good little uw student, my ultimate goal is working at one of those big competitive west coast companies, but i'll be satisfied as long as i get out of this country.  tl;dr: i'm a cs student capable of getting front end, full stack, and back end internships. i'm thinking about focusing on front end but worried it would limit my earning potential. i've seen conflicting views on this. is it a good idea?  edit: oh and also, is it ok to use js for leetcode style interviews that aren't for front end? i want to practice in the language that i'll actually be using each day for the next few months so i won't make syntax mistakes."
some coworkers get major tax benefits that others do not,bcgnw1,blank,throw_away_51029,17,1555120811.0,"my company is involved in a program called startup new york which essentially gives the company (and employees of that company) major tax advantages for headquartering in certain locations. for example, employees pay $0 state income tax! when i first joined onto this company (<1 year ago) i didn't know anything about this sny program, so it was never brought up in my salary negotiations.  turns out, due to some accounting issues a few years ago, my company messed up and had to pay some fees for violating the sny program. because of that, my company stopped hiring people in under the program (myself included.) but the majority of engineers at the company who are sny eligible, remain in the program. this basically means that compared to the coworker next to me, he may be getting a take-home pay that is at least 4, and potentially 5 figures larger than mine.  upon asking managers about the state of the program, they always just reply that it's something that's still up in the air - ""they're figuring out who is going to be eligible, or if they're going to re-instate the program for newer employees."" meanwhile, some engineers (myself included) are still paying those taxes. every time someone brings up sny at work (which is frequent, since it's tax season) i get pretty salty internally about the potential pay discrepancy.  i joined this company from a fang company which i believe allowed me to negotiate my salary higher than what most of my coworkers are making. however, as i mentioned, those negotiations happened with no mention of the sny program. i'm wondering how you guys recommend remedying the situation. does it make sense to argue for a pay raise even though i *think* my pre-tax salary is higher than most of my coworkers with similar experience? how do i argue that case?  thanks in advance for any advice!  edit: tl;dr (and clarification) - many coworkers have an added 'benefit' (so to speak) that allows them to avoid paying state income tax. does it make sense for me to ask for higher compensation to offset this benefit that i am missing out on?"

putting in more work but paid less?,cr27yi,blank,hapachino,8,1565964010.0,"i transitioned from an unrelated field after earning my second bachelor's in cs and got my first swe job earlier this year. the first few weeks i just felt overwhelmed with gratitude, like all the hard work paid off and i finally made it. but lately resentment has started creeping in over my salary.  in a vacuum, i'm actually quite happy with my pay - it's probably slightly below the local average, but significantly higher than my previous job. however, i recently found that a newer hire on our team is earning slightly more. a little background - he doesn't have a cs degree and his one year of experience was in a more font-facing role.  maybe real world experience, even front-facing, trumps a cs degree and that's fine. the problem is i'm literally doing like 10 times the amount of work, no exaggeration. i'm a fairly fast worker to be fair, but sometimes i look at the amount of work he's done and i just don't understand how he's done so little. it's become an inside joke within the team that i'm the carrying the frontend, which we and another guy work on. he even brought it up himself that i'm way more productive.   i've also taken on additional tasks such as architecting the frontend, creating the database and endpoints, creating test suites, helping with the build process, dockerizing the application, just to name a few. he's only 3 months in, but i've only got a couples months on him, and i was equally productive at that stage.  it just feels a little demoralizing. one coworker says i should definitely ask for a raise, which i'll probably do towards the end of the year. how should i go about negotiating to lessen the sense of inequity i'm feeling? and if they don't offer a significant raise, which companies usually don't, is it time to leave?"

not sure if i should renege for another opportunity,by23gj,blank,notsureaboutjob,8,1559983523.0,"i'm a relatively new grad (graduated last summer) and have been looking for work since then with no luck. a few weeks ago, i received an offer from company a, which i was of course very inclined to accept. to summarize key points about it:  * company is us based with multiple offices and is looking to expand and establish a large office in canada - i will be one of the first people to join this canadian team, which i believe will probably be a good opportunity for growth. their main product is software for utility companies. * salary is a bit on the low end of average, but i was told there were yearly bonuses and regular performance reviews. this may or may not be true as glassdoor reviews imply that performance reviews and growth do not happen as often or as easily as they were told they would * they will pay all costs for training trips as necessary in the us, but i need to work for them for at least 24 months (if i leave earlier, i may need to pay back training costs). * as they are still sorting out logistics in canada, i don't know what the benefits plan is but i was told there would be a ""competitive"" one by the time i start work. us employees report on glassdoor that the health benefits are pretty good and that they offer 401k matching, so i assume it might be similar in canada (but maybe without the retirement savings, at least not for a few months). * new office location should be good, in the downtown core which is a very easy commute for me * i don't know the exact technologies or project i will be working on, but i get the impression it will be web dev related (i was told during the interview process that they use angular and other newer technologies, and likely some c/java in the lower-level side).  * the contract mentioned that i may need to work overtime with no additional pay other than my regular salary  after accepting company a's offer, i continued to interview with a few loose ends that i had started before i received my offer, thinking that i would decide later if another opportunity comes up. lo and behold, i was given an offer early this week for company b. company b is a consulting company which wants to hire me as a permanent employee of theirs (in order to provide health benefits), whilst working for their client company. the client company's main product is not software - it's ecommerce related and it seems like devs work mainly on internal tools, the client's online storefront and the like.  * initial contract would be for 6 months at their client company with a very likely chance of extension or permanent employment for the client company. i could also pursue other opportunities afterwards with company b as a consultant. * salary is a bit better than company a, but not by an incredible amount * healthcare benefits seem decent, there are no retirement savings benefits * i would be working with a heavily functional codebase with react native / reactjs, go, redux, node.js and similar. * the team is pretty small overall, only about 30 people, but i was told they are very tight-knit * i am expected to work 37.5 h/week which leads me to believe overtime is not expected * office is a long commute - located about an hour away from me. i think this will be especially annoying in the winter.  vacation benefits are about the same for both companies, and neither company name has more clout than the other (they're both relatively unknown).   i'm having an extremely difficult time deciding on which company i should choose - i feel about equally towards both. it may have come to the point where i might just take company a so i don't have to deal with the lost integrity and trouble of reneging.  basically, i need opinions - which position is better for a future career? i get the impression that working for a large enterprise company that is very engineer oriented may be a better career start, but company b sounds like it might have better technologies."

experiencing discrimination at work.,a5xjgb,blank,throwawaysrj,20,1544763101.0,"this is a throwaway account since some guys at work use reddit.  the director of engineering who makes all of the hiring decisions only hires people that are specific religion. i do not want to name the religion because the situation is unique enough that if i did they could identify me on here.  it used to be a family run software shop that grew originally, the ceo was a member of the religious group and would give preference to member of the group as well.   we were recently acquired by a larger company and he retired. the company adopted us as their main product this year. hr does not know that out of 6 people on the engineering team only 1 is not from this particular group.   most of the people are graduates from this religious-based college.  i have been working for the company for three years and they hired a jr developer with less experience and equal education over me. they didn't even give me a chance to interview. he straight up told me i did not have enough experience.   i work as a technical support engineer and have done major development on our companies website that uses the same stack as our saas product. its a pretty small city and they use ember and c#. thats to say finding developers is hard here, finding developers that know our stack is even harder. they cant used the excuse that i didn't have enough experience when i had made major contributions to our code base and became the sole developer of our companies website site.  the reason this sucks is that if i leave it going to be very hard for me to find jr/associate level position that will pay what i need. i make 47k now which is under market value for the area, but i would really need to be making at least 65k which is on the high end.  this is because my wife works at the company as well and it would mean having to finance a used car, double the cost in gas (everything is a 30 minutes drive one way without traffic) so transportation cost add up.  i would also be giving up a good health insurance package.  my work life balance is great like i said i get to work with my wife and we have developed great friendships here. it would really be like losing a family.  they recently hired another member of their religious group as well.   working on a team by myself at a jr/assosite level is not a good thing. yes i get a lot of freedom to do what i want, but its impossible for me to get a code review done by engineering. every time i ask them to they say okay and the pull request just sits there for months.  i'm just wondering what i should do. i am stuck in a position now where i do not have any support and a ton of responsibility. it is forcing me to grow and learn which is a good thing but its super painful and stressful.  i found out today that the doe is going to be dropping third-party integrations on me because he does not trust the integrations team that does not work in the office to take over the work.  sorry for the long post. it's just a great situation turning sour simply because i don't believe in their religion. the doe has never given me any negative feedback and is always super nice to me and we have good conversations. i have even been to his house for a cookout. its just whenever i ask about any upcoming ob openings i get shot down instantly.   maybe i will talk to him in a more formal meeting and ask when they plan on hiring for a jr/associate role. i know he cant really use the excuse that i don't have the experience anymore since he is expecting me to take on thrid party integrations.   any feedback would be nice. normally i would leave but being in a small town and in such a good work environment with good benefits is making it hard."

career outlook with first job in angular?,az8zhz,blank,SixCivility,7,1552199464.0,"so i recently got my first web development job offer. the pay is higher than i hoped and the benefits are great. the company is fairly large, which has pros and cons, but i'm looking forward to learning a presumably more structured workflow. the only negative is they use angular.   i've been studying react since it's the most in-demand framework/library and continuing to trend upward. after getting over the initial shock of jsx, react feels very intuitive and straightforward. most of the time it feels like writing plain javascript and i love the freedom.  i've only briefly gotten into angular, but so far i'm not a fan. everything feels more abstract with more boilerplate, and the syntax and naming conventions are bleh like `[(ngmodel)]` and `*ngfor`. i mean who came up with this? most people seem to prefer react - can those who've used both tell me why they prefer angular? some say angular is more suited for ""enterprise"" projects, but i've heard large companies converting from angular to react as well.  i'm going to take job since the pay is great and it'll get my foot in the door. i'm sure i'll learn skills that will benefit me wherever i go, and developers change frameworks all the time, but i'm wondering how it will affect my career. if i want to get back into react later on, surely preference is given to previous react developers, all else equal. and can i expect the same pay increase if i move on to react compared to if i continue with angular?"

to confront them straight about my problems? i'm really at a tough spot right now so i would appreciate any help possible. thank you.  **tech stuff**   *currently i am put on a bunch of front-end projects which i admit, i'm not the most interested in (coming to work and just writing css), however i've been on projects where i was straight up put on as an illustrator/designer (have no proper background of being one). what i despise the most is that there is completely no workflow and coding standard whatsoever put in place so you get people pushing node modules or environment specific configurations onto master or have pull requests with a million merge conflicts or few hundred thousand line changes in which i have to fix. pull requests never get reviewed properly at all and i'm the only one who every writes any sort of documentation. everyone works with the ""if it is hard to write it should be hard to read"" mindset even on collaborative projects and let their ego get absolutely in the way when i try to propose better solutions to literally anything. project staging/production pipe-lining or usage of docker for projects that need them is absolutely non-existent with me being the first advocate for them. only recently, they have began using it and not only did i get zero credits of proposing something like that, i get treated like i have zero experience in any of these tools and hence am not allowed to work on any cloud/devops stuff. the worst bit of this is that no one realises this is wrong and whenever i try to speak up i get my opinions pushed aside. not only are the conflicts/configurations tedious to deal with, i usually have to fix these problems myself if i have to meet my own deadlines. my manager, being a manager, doesn't understand any of these issues and just end up assuming i cannot meet deadlines. as such, i either get placed on terrible ""media""/wordpress projects or mundane features of interesting projects with zero skills i can actually take away whilst meeting deadlines of 5-6 projects at once.*  **tl;dr**   getting overworked as a grad code monkey with questionable pay and want to find/transition to a higher paying job to support myself and family. don't know the best way to approach the transition phase. need help."

"should i quit? i am underpaid, my contract has been broken multiple times by my employer and now they want to take wfh away.",abzuz1,blank,Only_Vermicelli,3,1546504847.0,"sorry if i get mad in this post because this is literally my job and i'm freaked right out and hope people can be patient with me and see past the anger and caps, it's nothing at anyone here ofc! just the stuff that brought me to consider quitting in the first place :d <3 :d <3  -----  i live in a low col area and opportunities here are limited.  i graduated in april this year and landed this position shortly after, resulting in me at present having ~6 months of post grad experience ontop of a ~1.5 year internship. i do not currently know if i could get a job again here if i am being honest.   i should add my at rest blood pressure i had checked a few days ago when i went for a dental cleaning (idk why they check bp for a dental cleaning?) and it was 136. a few months ago when i went to see my family doctor it was 134. i never had this issue.   (i cannot imagine how high my bp is when i get emails from clients swearing at me or screaming about things that should never break in a system breaking. i cannot go into detail but we're talking some basic fundamental core functionality. i don't disagree with the client either. it's unacceptable.)  i truly don't know. and right now i am getting ""official experience"" which is a blessing because while i can hack away at home for hours on end it's not apparently enough to get an employer to care i exist.   for this job they have: 1: denied me healthcare when they told me i would have healthcare, only fairly recently getting it to me after complaints were made. it was scheduled to be upon commencement of employment.  2: never did a salary review that was baked into the contract.  3: never updated my title of my job, which it should be read as junior software developer or the likes and was promised to me to happen. yes that is my actual job but my title is different. i am doing the react, java etc etc programming.   4: now, and it is mentioned absolutely 100% in the contract, they want to take away my ability to wfh. and i have come in whenever requested such as meetings or when requested, even if the thing i was requested for never happens that day and i came in for literally no reason.   this is a big point because:  -the office is loud and has distracting people come in open the door and go ""hey guys"" and startle me and completely break my focus.   -light literally pours into where i sit and the light can and does get into my eyes.  -i want privacy flat out i do not like the way things are there.   -i respectfully want nothing to do with anyone there because i am dealing with my own issues:  ------ i have ptsd i am looking to get treated right now i have ignored for years from my rape. and yes for the record i mean penatrative rape, twice in one ""session"". yeah, i'm trying to deal with it. it's ~4 years late but i need to deal with it now because flashbacks mid workday aren't cute.  ------ i am dealing with general anxiety as well.  ------ i am dealing with losing a 2 year ltr that i tbqh care about infinitely more than this job. i was going to get married in a year, now idk where things are at.  ------ and the drama associated with that ltr like not being invited to weddings, inner family shame, the dad avoiding me when i went over, me having to hide in a car when they visited their grandfather and me feeling like i probably got heat stroke. and so much more.  ------ my mother falling to pieces because her mother (my grandmother) went after her. because my mother's biological father passed away and she got not even the sentimental ring from him passing on and 0 acknowledgement.  and just more. wfh i knew ~6 months ago when i signed the freaking contract was. a. huge. huge. huge. huge. deal.  in fact looking back these things in the contract were why i took the job in the first place. - i like healthcare, but i sure as heck didn't get it until just recently. ""upon commencement of employment"" does not equal many months in. - i strongly prefer to wfh for the reasons mentioned above.   ----------- but wait, there's more!:  i know i am a new grad, and so i got warning signs during the interview that i ignored. this company is on the smaller side and even in the interview huge warning signs were everywhere telling me ""don't freaking do this!"" ""you will regret this!"".  examples: -i asked them some basic questions on architecture and even before i got into the code i knew there were some ghastly issues just there.  -the owner of the company was in my interview and tbqh seemed super aloof and like he was better than me and even as he grabbed me resume just crinkled the fuck out of the paper.  dude literally asked me after checking over my resume if i could write code for 8 hours a day. a real coding job.  say my nose is out of place or i am prideful but if i wasn't a new-grad and i had options i would have just walked out right then and there. i did a real coding job for ~1.5 years where i worked on a project dramatically more significant than this one.  -their initial offer to me was part time that i obviously declined and so respect for me is clearly low from the get-go.  -their system has no documentation. at all. none. when i came in we had none. we didn't even have slack or skype or any way to communicate outside of outlook email.  -i spent days trying to figure out errors so far. days. the system is in a complete state of carnage and chaos and me and a person hired the same time as me are desperately trying to break up new functionality of the system into microservices and such because we don't want to frigging deal with the old code base that is so horrendously bad.  -they have tried to do shady things like literally get into other companies to write down all their features and that.  -they have 0 comprehension what they are doing right now should be done by a bigger development team than the number of digits on one hand.  ...  there's just so much more and there's no point in me going into it in more detail on my issues those ways. there's tons.  ----------- my feelings:  i am a new grad and scared i won't be able to find another job. not sure how i'd build ""experience officially"" and land a new job. the city i live in is not filled to the brim with software opportunities. i'm on the verge of nearly 2 years experience and can do db, frontend and backend pretty stupidly easily but i'm worried about getting a job because ""experience officially"" comes from having a real job and not hacking away at home.  i am really pissed off right now. the contract itself that i signed has been broken over and over and over again and now they plan to take wfh away.  i am making the same salary i did when i was hired as an intern prior to my 1.5 years exp at the internship and now nearly 6 months here. i cannot and do not want to pay the gas to drive an hour there and an hour back. furthermore i live up north meaning the roads are extremely dangerous to boot and gas to heat the vehicle along with the hour long drive... may as well torch another few thousand off my take home that is already pretty bad.    ----------- ""okay why is the office so bad?""  - it's hard to focus on my job there rather than at home. there are a lot of distractions and a lot of stress and tbqh it's so much more productive for me to just walk to my desk at home and get shit done and read up on new tech if i need to.  - sunlight bathes where i sit and tbqh is intensely distracting. i want the blinds closed because the sun comes in on me and it's horrendous. i am bathed in sunlight and i do not like it. it strains my eyes and makes me feel uncomfortable and overheated. even with the blinds shut some still comes through.  - it's an hour long drive there. and an hour long drive back. meaning i lose 2 hours of my day. and the gas is expensive, way too expensive to add ontop of my already low takehome. tbqh pay me 10-20k extra and i'll consider this, which is what i should be paid in the first place.   - i am addressing ptsd i got from me being raped years ago as i said above. that's a huge thing and i don't want to have flashbacks in the office. at all.  - i don't want to go into your office where people are loud and distracting and randomly opening the door and shouting. i don't want to go into your office where a guy literally will grab food off of your desk and shove it into their mouth. again, are we in jr. high?  - coworker i work with has said many homophobic, elitist and other awful things in general. none directed at me ofc because that wouldn't make sense, but just in general.   something bad happens ""that's gay"". what, are we back in jr. high? one coworker for instance during a meeting flat out said people are idiots and it blew me away. lots of over extremely offensive stuff.  listen, i don't care to be frank about people's opinions but i don't want to be constantly exposed to that negativity and bullshit. i just don't want to deal with it. i don't want to be in a negative environment that enjoys ridiculing people over stupid shit.           ....  so i guess facts are idk what to do. i'm angry and sad at the same time."
software enginering co-op vs. test automation intern,b3gk91,blank,0100001101011001,2,1553140436.0,i've read a lot of old posts comparing software engineering to software test engineers but i want to get an updated opinion and ask about my specific situation.  last summer i did a software engineering co-op at a fortune 500 company. they offered for me to come back this summer but i also got an offer to be a test automation engineer at a different company (equally as large).   would the summer internship as a test automation engineer benefit me if i ultimately want to be a software engineer in the long run? like what would be better on my resume \[2 summers of software engineering at the same company\] or \[1 summer se and 1 summer as an automated test engineer at different companies\]?  note: pay doesn't matter to me but the se co-op pays $4 an hour more than the test engineering position
my option grant contract up to scratch (concerned about repurchase/claw back),ayfhh6,blank,tommywommywom,1,1552010067.0,"hello   &#x200b;  i'm just accepting a startup offer and am going through their equity incentive plan. i have no plans to leave, but if i do leave, i want to make sure that i won't loose my options to claw back/company repurchasing them from me.   &#x200b;  i've copy/pasted most of the legal speak in below. i've been over it twice so far, and can't see anywhere where it says the company would be able to take their options back even after i've exercised them, however the language is very dense to me, so i would appreciate more experienced eyes to put my mind at rest.  &#x200b;  another thing - i only have 3 months after leaving to make a decision to exercise stock. isn't that a little on the low side (low but industry standard?). should i/can i push back on this?      this option shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, according to the following vesting schedule:  \[twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares subject to the option shall vest on the one (1) year anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and one forty-eighth (1/48th) of the shares subject to the option shall vest each month thereafter on the same day of the month as the vesting commencement date (and if there is no corresponding day, on the last day of the month), subject to participant continuing to be a service provider through each such date.\]  termination period:  this option shall be exercisable for three (3) months after participant ceases to be a service provider, unless such termination is due to participant’s death or disability, in which case this option shall be exercisable for twelve (12) months after participant ceases to be a service provider. notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in no event may this option be exercised after the term/expiration date as provided above and this option may be subject to earlier termination as provided in section 13 of the plan.  # i. agreement  ##

11. no guarantee of continued service. participant acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of shares pursuant to the vesting schedule hereof is earned only by continuing as a service provider at the will of the company (or the parent or subsidiary employing or retaining participant) and not through the act of being hired, being granted this option or acquiring shares hereunder. participant further acknowledges and agrees that this agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as a service provider for the vesting period, for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere in any way with participant’s right or the right of the company (or the parent or subsidiary employing or retaining participant) to terminate participant’s relationship as a service provider at any time, with or without cause.  participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the plan and represents that he or she is familiar with the terms and provisions thereof, and hereby accepts this option subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof. participant has reviewed the plan and this option in their entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this option and fully understands all provisions of the option. participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the administrator upon any questions arising under the plan or this option. participant further agrees to notify the company upon any change in the residence address indicated below.  &#x200b;    \---------------  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  1. exercise of option. effective as of today, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, the undersigned (“participant”) hereby elects to exercise participant’s option (the “option”) to purchase \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shares of the common stock (the “shares”) of xyz inc (the “company”) under and pursuant to the 2018 equity incentive plan (the “plan”) and the stock option agreement dated \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_ (the “option agreement”).  2. delivery of payment. participant herewith delivers to the company the full purchase price of the shares, as set forth in the option agreement, and any and all withholding taxes due in connection with the exercise of the option.  3. representations of participant. participant acknowledges that participant has received, read and understood the plan and the option agreement and agrees to abide by and be bound by their terms and conditions.  4. rights as shareholder. until the issuance of the shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the common stock subject to an award, notwithstanding the exercise of the option. the shares shall be issued to participant as soon as practicable after the option is exercised in accordance with the option agreement. no adjustment shall be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance except as provided in section 13 of the plan.  5. company’s right of first refusal. before any shares held by participant or any transferee (either being sometimes referred to herein as the “holder”) may be sold or otherwise transferred (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the company or its assignee(s) shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the shares on the terms and conditions set forth in this section 5 (the “right of first refusal”).

(b) participant acknowledges and understands that the securities constitute “restricted securities” under the securities act and have not been registered under the securities act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of participant’s investment intent as expressed herein. in this connection, participant understands that, in the view of the securities and exchange commission, the statutory basis for such exemption may be unavailable if participant’s representation was predicated solely upon a present intention to hold these securities for the minimum capital gains period specified under tax statutes, for a deferred sale, for or until an increase or decrease in the market price of the securities, or for a period of one (1) year or any other fixed period in the future. participant further understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the securities act or an exemption from such registration is available. participant further acknowledges and understands that the company is under no obligation to register the securities. participant understands that the certificate evidencing the securities shall be imprinted with any legend required under applicable state securities laws.  (c) participant is familiar with the provisions of rule 701 and rule 144, each promulgated under the securities act, which, in substance, permit limited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly from the issuer thereof, in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. rule 701 provides that if the issuer qualifies under rule 701 at the time of the grant of the option to participant, the exercise shall be exempt from registration under the securities act. in the event the company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, ninety (90) days thereafter (or such longer period as any market stand-off agreement may require) the securities exempt under rule 701 may be resold, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified by rule 144, including in the case of affiliates (1) the availability of certain public information about the company, (2) the amount of securities being sold during any three (3) month period not exceeding specified limitations, (3) the resale being made in an unsolicited “broker’s transaction”, transactions directly with a “market maker” or “riskless principal transactions” (as those terms are defined under the securities exchange act of 1934) and (4) the timely filing of a form 144, if applicable.  in the event that the company does not qualify under rule 701 at the time of grant of the option, then the securities may be resold in certain limited circumstances subject to the provisions of rule 144, which may require (i) the availability of current public information about the company; (ii) the resale to occur more than a specified period after the purchase and full payment (within the meaning of rule 144) for the securities; and (iii) in the case of the sale of securities by an affiliate, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in sections (2), (3) and (4) of the paragraph immediately above.  (d) participant further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of rule 701 or 144 are not satisfied, registration under the securities act, compliance with regulation a, or some other registration exemption shall be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that rules 144 and 701 are not exclusive, the staff of the securities and exchange commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to rules 144 or 701 shall have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk. participant understands that no assurances can be given that any such other registration exemption shall be available in such event."
is it still realistic to say that any quantitative degree works?,a5mysg,blank,CollegeKidThroweway9,7,1544681546.0,"as the title implies, i'm wondering what the actual reality is, in the current world we live in, of successfully majoring in another 'related' field to cs and getting internships and employment from it. this is a personal question, so the specific field i'm wondering about is majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science.   now, don't get me wrong, i would like to pursue what i enjoy, but i'm also realistic about the fact that i won't use higher mathematics probably ever outside of school, and i would rather study something interesting enough and have money after i graduate than to study math and struggle for the rest of my life.  so, here are the issues that bother me the most. if you have a counter or an affirmation to them, please share your experience.  1.) you always hear about how projects are such a huge deal, but this seems like a major issue if you are pursuing a degree in a non-cs field, the reason being that you are fighting an uphill battle of learning another field(arguably harder, in the case of mathematics) then learning the basics on your own that the cs major learned in class, and then doing projects. these seems either impossible or a recipe for burnout.  2.) i won't be able to get internships in school, which in turn will lead to struggle in the real world. it's one thing to be a graduated mathematics major, but up until your junior year, you really want have much in the way of ""real"" mathematics under your belt. is it realistic to expect companies to hire a person like this?  3.) finally, even assuming that i can get an internship, how is the fact that i have an unrelated degree not going to weigh into the decision as to hiring me or not? i would like to believe this is true, for selfish reasons, but even i wouldn't consider hiring a proven programmer with a mathematics degree over an equally proven programmer with a computer science degree.  in essence, i love math greatly, i study math for fun, and on the same merit, i love coding greatly, i code for fun. either way i will likely continue to do the other, but a degree is a hefty investment nowadays and i need to know that i can pay the debt i will accrue off in a realistic time frame."

imposter syndrome vs lack of direction rant,af2wqp,blank,errminator,4,1547288194.0,"hi all,  first of all, let me introduce my background: i have a phd in theoretical physics which i completed three years ago. up to this point in my life i had never really touched programming - my phd was pen and paper calculations.  sadly, there has not been much demand for string theorists in the job market recently. as such i went on to teach high school maths and physics at a top school. this was pretty interesting as there were some extremely able students who i was able to teach undergraduate material to. plus the long holidays have allowed me to travel the world. the pay has been pretty good also and i have completely cleared my existing student debt and saved around 40k over the three years i've been doing this.  however seeing some of the top students proceed to prestigious universities and careers, along with seeing some of my contemporaries progress there own professional lives has resparked my interest in doing something like this myself. over the last three years i have been teaching myself programming and machine learning in the evenings. i do not feel comfortable to sit down and write an algorithm yet though which is giving me some imposter syndrome. as such i have applied to, and been accepted for, the ucl msc in machine learning.  i now need to decide whether i will accept it.  argument for: would give a solid understanding would probably open up more jobs  argument against: need to be a student again (would be my 10th year!!!) living in london and tuition would wipe out my savings could get a job and try to learn on the job not clear this is the area for me - very indecisive person   ultimately, i'm not sure ml jobs would be for me. sadly the only way to decide this is to try it and the masters seems an expensive way to do this.   i guess i want a job that is  1, intellectually challenging 2, offers opportunity for management progression (that's why i think financial jobs might be best bet?)  3, commands some respect from friends/family  4, feels like i'm doing some good in the world (concerned the majority of ml jobs are just doing advertisement grunt work for corporations?)   as i get older my patience for doing a job that doesn't offer a reasonable quality of life is fast diminishing. i suppose this is more of a rant but i'd welcome some community feedback on it. did anyone else find themselves equally lost?"
"m.e to software dev: opportunity for paid java bootcamp with 2 year consulting commitment (most likely banks in charlotte or dallas). hoping to get some questions answered, opinions and feedback to those who have done this.",9gzuug,blank,UbiquitousThoughts,10,1537341391.0,"background: mechanical engineer transitioning to software dev.  an opportunity has come up  that pays for an immersive bootcamp then hires me as a consultant with a 2 year commitment, mostly working on projects for their clients which are banks. this will be in charlotte, nc so bofa or wells fargo i presume. the details are as follows:  1. i will be paid $600/week to attend a 12 week bootcamp ($20k value which is  a bit higher than most but accurate) 2. once completed i will be a consultant for the recruitment agency for two years working on projects with their clients. this will most likely be application projects.  \- $50k salary for the first year and then $60k salary for the second year. may be lower a bit lower than cs grads but seems reasonable, i am okay with it. i realize they make money off me for these two years but also invested a lot.  3. they are committed to keeping me on as a consultant until i get a job, they hope with their client for the referral bonus. however it is not mandatory.  4. if i quit before 15 months (she said that but the two year thing doesnt make sense then) i must pay them back the $20k.  **questions, etc:**  1. does anything sound sketchy to you or is it really a situation where the demand is that much higher than the supply and this is a good money making opportunity for them that benefits me? 2. those who work for banks, preferrably not interns, how do you like it. pros/cons? 3. will working with/for a bank give me good experience or does the bureaucracy resist that? 4. how does the industry view experience with a bank. is it a postitive for eventually applying to a tech company later on? 5. anyone go through a route similar to this that can provide feedback?  &#x200b;  thanks a lot for sharing.  &#x200b;  **edit:**  i did some due diligence and contacted a couple people that just completed the first course. the setup is just like revature but here is what i gathered. the camp is $13k plus the $600/week equals the $20k they front. i spoke to two people who were completely satisfied with the bootcamp, although pricey it did get the ball rolling for them as far as coding goes and they had great things to say about attending a bootcamp. out of the first group, some were not placed (possibly beacuse they are unwilling to relocate) and a few  got  decent jobs with  defense contractors etc. which took 3-4 months getting paid the $600/week. but i would consider them success stories. so it is possible. they are commited to placing you and it is in their best interest to do so. they are moving the program to places that have higher demand so perhaps it will pan out better in the mentioned cities.  **however,** there were people attending the bootcamp along with the group hired by the recruiting agency and almost all of them got placed upon leaving the bootcamp at around $65k (but minus the $20k investment) and had the ability to choose where they applied, obviously.  it is a risk of $0 income after but there were good hiring rates for this example.  &#x200b;  **pros:** if you are not a self learner, don't have the $20k to front (camp plus living) and don't care where you get placed. go for it. it is in their best interest to place you so they are trying to do so and will do so eventually. that is how they make money and $50k/$60k plus the $20k they fronted really isn't a bad deal.  **cons:** they are only trying to place you with their clients. i think this is the problem with placing people. we know the demand is out there so these programs sort of restrict the job market for you. you don't get consultant pay until you land a project which could be a few months after the bootcamp. lastly, they send you wherever they want. you have the ability to deny (i think because the people not wanting to relocate didn't) but in the end you are not involved in the placement process at all.   &#x200b;  **tl;dr**   **i will not be attending but it is not a scam or a bad option for certain people. it is all situational. bootcamps can be a great option, depending on the camp and city. if i attend one, it will most likely be out of my location to ensure a better placement chance.**"

how i was promoted to management in my first 90 days (without ever meeting my new boss),9ftuyf,blank,agmckee,4,1536974044.0,"let’s be honest, the opening of a job with a higher responsibility and (typically) a higher salary comes few and far between at our companies and in our careers. a promotion can skyrocket your career, introduce new challenges that will grow your skills, and instantly move you higher up the ladder. but when this rare opportunity comes along, will you get passed-over? will it be the coworker that:   · hasn't been at the company as long as you?  · hasn't developed a long-term relationship with the hiring manager like you have?  · hasn't yet been given awards, raises, and bonuses like you have?  that coworker was me. and it can be you too. learn how i strategically cut-the-line and was promoted to management in my first 90 days - all from the comforts of my new fully-remote, work-from-home job - never having met my new boss. the following are a couple key techniques and mind-sets you should practice, remotely or in-office, that can quickly land you your next raise or promotion.    &#x200b;  **be the boss**  “a critical mindset needed to position yourself as the best candidate for a raise or promotion.”  you’ve sold your exceptional value to your new company and they are willing to pay – now it is time to deliver that value. know that no matter how long you’ve had the job, there are extra things you can do that your coworkers never will. but before you can pull out that hidden ace, you need to start changing your mindset and how people perceive you. specifically, you need to adopt the mindset of “the boss.”  most people have the employee mindset. as employees, they narrowly think only about their job, their responsibilities, and their small corner of the company.  what is amazing is how this narrow mindset can actually limit your perceived value to the company, especially when your management sees the flipside of this mindset in other people around you.  different than an employee, the boss thinks about the company as a whole and what improvements can be made in all corners that make-up the business. this is expected of the boss. what is not expected is an employee with the mindset of the boss. those employees with the boss mindset are playing an entirely different game – one that will give them an advantage vs. every other “employee”.   having the boss mindset can be powerful if used strategically. one key area is in networking with those in your company. those with the employee mindset will typically network mostly with people at their same position level, and of course their own boss. they may know other managers, but the strength of their network connection with them is weak.   with the boss mentality, put yourself in your boss’ shoes and make it essential to take the time to learn about the people and positions that are above you - something you would have to do if you were promoted anyways. a good strategy is to start with your direct manager and branch out horizontally. your three goals in networking with your upper management are to:  1) gain immediate visibility and form a connection  2) personalize yourself  3) search for ways to add value to their lives and deliver it  we will address #3, below, and how to strategically add value.  understandably, there are a lot of fears people have with reaching out to a person in a high position of power or influence. they may say things like, “i don’t know what to talk about?”, or “why would they want to talk to me?”, or “they are probably too busy”. these are normal fears to have, which is why having the boss mentality, and thinking of these people as your coworkers can make this an easier task.   here is how to approach your first conversation with your upper management. first request a brief \~15minute meeting face-to-face or over the phone with the purposes of finding out what they do in more detail. assume they are very busy, so a 15minute meeting becomes even more attractive and increases the likelihood they will accept. in this meeting, you should:  1) introduce yourself and learn what they are responsible for and how they contribute to the company.  2) pick something they said and explain how you thought it was interesting or relate it to your own personal or professional interests  3) tell them something personal about yourself like a hobby, interest, or trip you’ve been on. then ask them what hobbies, interests, or vacation spots they enjoy.  4) thank them for their time and let them know you would be interested in getting to know them further, or talk about x,y,z at another time.   a simple and quick conversation like this is essential for forming the foundations of a great relationship and a strong network. you will also be one step ahead of all other’s stuck in the “employee” mindset. but top-performers do not stop here. now that our foundation is starting, we have an opportunity to build on the relationships we created with upper management so that we can add an immense amount of value to their lives and stand miles above anyone else around you.   **search and deploy**  “the #1 strategy i used to immediately stand out from my peers and unload an immense amount of value in my first 90 days.”  the following is my #1 strategy for adding crazy amounts of value to your company - beyond your job’s core responsibilities. the good news is you can start implementing this strategy no matter how long you’ve been working at your job, or whether you work at home or in an office. better yet, your management will be completely blindsided at first. and you will immediately prove you are worth what they are paying you and more.   the strategy breaks down to two simple steps:      1) with the boss mentality, **search** for key problems, inefficiencies, and pain points that other people and organizations have, but especially with your coworkers, your boss, and upper management  2) **deploy** solutions, feedback, processes, automation, improvements, etc. to those pain points in a calculated and strategic way, which if done correctly, will add value and visibility.  most people never think outside their box, having the employee mindset and just working on what they are assigned. they accept being led, instead of leading. let’s get more specific on how to implement the search and deploy strategy.  **search**  remember that you are searching for ways to improve your company, your organization, or the people in it – in any way. with that said, know that the bigger the problem is to someone, the more valuable you will be if you solve it.  although, large problems are typically more difficult to solve. so, don’t just search for the quick and easy problems. instead, search for the big wins - the big unsolved problems that affect multiple people and especially that affect your team, your boss, and your upper management. although, don’t rule out the strength in numbers approach of searching for and solving several small to medium problems, which is actually how i recommend you start.  know that some problems and pain points will be easier to find than others. that doesn’t necessarily mean the big problems will be the hardest to find. in fact, sometimes the big problems are more out in the open more than the small ones. remember the big problems are typically very complex and hard to solve, and therefore remain unsolved but widely known and accepted by many. therefore, uncovering a small to medium sized problem that provides you an opportunity for a quick win can be harder to find.   regardless, it is easiest to start with what’s in front of you - with the low-hanging fruit. start searching for people that are specifically asking you or an audience for help. for example, some people may email you and a larger audience asking for help with a specific problem they are having. you also may overhear talking with your coworkers of an inefficiency your team has. these are situations where your coworkers are directly or indirectly telling you problems. directly meaning they are specifically asking for a solution. indirectly meaning they could be discussing the problem as a form of conversation and not specifically asking for help.  either way, these are examples of low-hanging fruit you can easily harvest – free and ripe for the taking. make sure you listen for them.   beyond the low-hanging fruit, you will need to talk with people in order to dig out their hidden pain points. this is true especially for people that you don’t regularly converse with, like upper management or people in other organizations. this is why having already established a relationship with these people is key before digging in. people are more willing to talk about their challenges and problems with someone they trust will not judge them.  from just a couple conversations with someone i’ve never met, i can typically dig out at least one main pain point they have. you can too.   once a relationship and trust have been built, you can ask questions like, “what are your biggest challenges at this time with \[specific job function\]”. if they respond, try to dig deeper. ask questions like, “why hasn’t this already been solved?” or “that’s interesting. tell me more. specific followup question.”   it is important to actually listen and to care what they are saying. your search has to seem natural and subtle. no one wants to feel like they are being interrogated or drilled. the conversation also has to “ping-pong” naturally, which won’t happen with a person who isn’t truly listening.  from actively listening to the conversations around you for problems or pain points, you will want to start recording them in a central document. i call this document your “value vault”.  with a value vault, you can:  · record your notes from conversations surrounding pain points and problems  · better identify patterns with problems and pain points after talking to many people  · easily continue conversations with others where you left off, instead of having to remember.  · start documenting possible solutions you will deploy to the problems you discover from the people you talk to  a value vault is especially useful when working from home because of the ability to reference and edit it while you are having conversations, and the other person on the phone will never know! whereas in the office, you would look very stupid pulling out your computer and writing down notes while having a candid face-to-face meeting with your coworker.   **deploy**  with your value vault growing, you can at any time start working on deploying solutions to the problems and pain points you’ve uncovered. sometimes a solution can be a quick email reply with a concrete answer to someone’s question, which doesn’t require much planning. although some problems are more complex or affect a larger group, which may require a solution to be deployed very strategically.  regardless, there are two important factors to deploying solutions successfully, to ensure that they not only provide value, but will be accepted by those who need them. they are:   · quality  · timing  **quality**   if there is one thing you should remember from this strategy it should be quality over quantity.  don’t just spam out mediocre solutions or advice to your colleagues whenever you discover a problem they have. not only will you come across as a know-it-all, your actual perceived value will decrease. people around you will realize you don’t put true thought into solving their problems, which over time can lead to a perception that you do the same with your main responsibilities.   on the other hand, a quality solution to someone’s problem will improve your reputation as a key contributor and an idea-leader.  take the extra time needed to offer quality. it is true that spending 2 to 5 times more time on a quality solution can bring you 10x+ the rewards. so how do you determine how much quality to put into a solution? enough to make your boss and others say phrases like:  · “wow, you put a lot of thought into this!”  · “thank you, i really appreciate all the alternatives you suggested to solve this problem!”  · “let’s start working towards implementing this”   · “how do we hire more people like your name?”  understandably you won’t be able to solve every problem with equal quality as everyone has different strengths. therefore, be strategic and leverage your strengths and your past experience from past jobs to create your quality solutions.   **timing**  timing is also an important factor to consider when determining when to propose a solution. truthfully, it’s always good to solve people’s problems, but there are certain times that are better than others – times that can give you more visibility than others.  as already stated, we don’t want to release our solutions before it is ready and quality. although beyond that, we can be more strategic around the timings of our deployments.   remember, why you are spending the time to implement this strategy is to immediately stand out from your peers and unload an immense amount of value. we know that the value is there because of your time commitment to quality. you should now be thinking about the best time to pitch your solutions that would make you stand out the most.  the following are 4 examples of some very intelligent times to implement this strategy:  · during your first 3 months of employment  · 1 month before yearly performance reviews  · at a yearly conference or summit  · after a change in management, especially your manager’s position  there are others, but what do these times all have in common? they are the most critical moments in your career when you should be standing out and giving it your all. a deployment of massive value during these times can help you towards getting huge raises, a promotion, wide visibility, and immediate job security. therefore, choose your timings strategically according to your own situation and goals.   in addition to the actual day you choose to deploy/pitch a solution, remember that people who haven’t specifically asked for help will be more receptive of your solutions if they know and trust you. therefore, when thinking about timing, also factor in your relationship strength with those that will be affected by the solution and those that are the gatekeepers of getting the solution implemented. for example, if you are pitching a complex project proposal to address a big corporate inefficiency, ensure that all the relevant stakeholders have been identified and know you. even better, individually talk to each of the stakeholders that will either approve or reject your solution beforehand to ensure their requirements are met and concerns known. if you can get the important people to buy-in beforehand, then you will always be more successful at deploying your solutions.   **examples of two strategic wins that got me immediate visibility in my first 90 days**  **grabbing the low-hanging fruit**  one day my future boss (the one who promoted me to management) reached out to a wide audience asking for help in reviewing one of our product’s documentation. this was a regular request of hers every time we were about to release a major software change. she would email everyone in our support and service organization which included over 100 people and typically no one would respond. why? because they didn’t have to. it wasn’t something that was their immediate responsibility.   i saw this as a low-hanging fruit opportunity to flex my writing and editing skills and to show my boss and this manager i had never met the value i was capable of delivering. what i didn’t do was skim a few pages, find a couple things to correct, and email them out quickly. because that is what everyone else did! instead, i focused on quality and spend about 8 to 10 hours in total reading through the whole document and making over 100 corrections and comments. i tore that document to pieces knowing that by investing 2x to 5x the time, i would receive 10x+ the recognition.   not only did i do the work, i ensured that my work was promoted as much as possible to upper management (we will talk more about promotion in the next section). before completion, i leaked out that i was making several edits to the documentation. then upon completion, i was not only thanked by the product team and my future boss, people were surprised that someone in my position had spent so much time on this task! when asked why, i took the “all eyes on me” opportunity to promote my “desire to add value to the company in any way possible” (be the boss) mindset.    **uncovering a hidden pain point while training**  the first 90 days of my new job was considered a training period (yes i was promoted while still in training). as i was navigating through my organization’s training program, i couldn’t help but notice several inefficiencies and gaps compared to my previous job’s structured training program. the problem was, there really was no structure! i was told to talk with my coworkers to learn the ropes and in 3 months’ time i should be ready to take on the full load of responsibilities.   seeing a possible opportunity to add value by recommending a training structure, i first started talking with my coworkers about their training experiences. i heard things like, “ya, i had to just figure it out” and “ya, i wish it was more structured, but that’s just the way things are done here” and “there’s a lot of tribal knowledge here that isn’t documented”. isn’t it amazing how people just don’t care to make things better? they just accept things the way they are. they think, “it’s not my job to make the training process structured and efficient”. that is true - it was my boss’ job to do that, but they are leaving opportunities to shine on the table – yours for the taking.  it’s important to note with this example that my boss was producing this culture. situations like these are where you have to be careful to not offend your boss by offering solutions because sometimes they are not even aware of a hidden pain point they are creating! here it is important to sniff out whether your boss would accept a solution to this problem before dumping one out on his desk. i did this casually in one of our one-on-one meetings by saying, “hey name, as i’m ramping up my learning, along the way i’m noticing things that would possibly help the next trainee get up to speed even quicker, would you mind if i documented my lessons learned on my training experiences and submit them to you?” notice that i’m giving my boss control to say yes or no before blindsiding him with a hidden problem and a massively detailed training process plan? this is critical. of course, who wouldn’t say yes to something like this, but the point is that i first gained acceptance from him to offer lessons learned (which is actually constructive criticism) to his (lack there-of) training program.  also notice that i left out my knowledge of my co-worker’s pain points with the training gap, which was to not offend my boss.   i now had a green light to recommend some changes. did i email him a few tips? no. i focused on quality and put together a massively valuable package of training recommendations that made a big impact. in the end, i made my boss look good, and helped out my current and future coworkers.   two examples of how powerful the boss mentality mixed with the search and deploy strategy can be.   i believe these two deployments tipped the scale in my favor when that promotion opened up, because the first thing my new manager said to me was, “we have a recent opening on the management team and i’ve been talking to \[name of my current manager\], and we both think you are the best fit for that position.”   again, having the boss mentality and practicing the search and deploy strategy at key times is the ultimate way to add an immense amount of value beyond your job’s core responsibilities. whether you are working in an office, or fully-remote, you can quickly become highly visible to upper management and change how they see you. you can quickly position yourself as an idea-leader, validate your worth, and position yourself above your coworkers.  although, one more important skill is critical to exercise in order to ensure success with the above tactics and strategies - that is the art of self-promotion, which i wont get into here.   i hope you all found this useful!"
how to value compensation at a startup vs. airbnb?,9to5p6,blank,hubertpotato,1,1541221859.0,"i'm currently considering multiple startups (series b, valuation  $50 million) and airbnb.  if compensation were equal, i would definitely take the startup (i enjoy the work and people more) but i'm having trouble understanding what a competitive compensation at a top-tier startup is and how much of a pay cut i should be willing to take.  offers at these startups are ~120k base and options are in the range of 50k-70k over 4 years (subtracting fmv by strike price).  my airbnb offer is looking to be about $150k base and $300k in equity.  these startups are absolutely unwilling to match by airbnb offer in cash and equity. they tell me to ignore the ""current value"" of the options and think about the future and growth potential. most of the times, they tell me that this growth potential is 10x. for what it's worth, i do believe in the growth potential of these companies and they're doing really well, but i don't want to bank on a 10x.  should i listen to their advice and settle for a substantial pay cut (~80k)? what equity at a promising series b startup would be competitive with the airbnb offer?  also, i've heard of the argument that you should value options at startups as 0. i completely disagree with this side of the spectrum as well (there must be a non-zero expected value), especially at an extremely promising startup that's been able to attract top talent and is doing really well."

how do you think the field be looking about five years from now?,7n30ao,blank,Jimwize,35,1514686169.0,"you can skip straight to the questions if you don't want to read all of this stereotypical worrying.  computer science is my planned major, but i'm not sure how good of an idea this is as a high school senior graduating in 2018. i'm already accepted into uw-madison, but i'm somewhat anxious about going to college because of how much debt it will likely put me in. therefore, i want to pick a field that will reward me for working very hard in college so that i can get a high paying and enjoyable career shortly after graduation.  now i know that this is what literally every college student is looking for, and this is why i'm a little worried about majoring in cs. i would think that by now this field is crazy saturated with undergraduates, many of whom being very competent and intelligent. **i've seen people back in 2014 talking about how it's getting oversaturated and harder to get work- i can only imagine what the field will be like 5 years from now if i get a degree in it.**  so that's my first question-   1. do you think the field will still outgrow the enormous amount of people who are studying this in college? it's always been the go-to 'make money after college' major, so i feel like it will be hard to stand out from everyone and get internships/work.  my next question concerns how important my university choice is for this. like i said, i'll be getting a ton of debt from a four year college plan, so i need to know just how important the name of my college is after graduation, or if bigger colleges are going to offer bigger opportunities in terms of networking and internships and all of that. uw-madison is more expensive than other state schools i've been accepted to, like uw-eau claire, but perhaps more companies are going to higher straight from uw-madison, or the name is going to mean way more to bigger companies.   2. how important is my choice of school for my post-college success? specifically, will choosing uw-madison over some other wisconsin school make a huge difference in your eyes provided i'm equally involved and successful in both?  my final question concerns stuff about engineering. based purely off feel, it seems like an engineering degree, whether or not it involves computers, would make more sense now for finding a job. it would certainly appear that with how many people are gunning for cs degrees, there are going to be would-be engineers who go to this new and growing field and there will be a strong need for majors in computer engineering, chemical engineering, etc. so is a worry like this just anxious speculation, or is there some truth to this? i have to ask because right now i'm accepted in the college of letters and science at uw-madison, and to switch to the college of engineering would be difficult at this point.  3. will engineering become way more in demand with how many people are attracted to the cs bachelors degree? cs is probably a better fit for me, but with how many people are going into it i can't help but feel like engineering of some kind might be a smarter path.  finally- is a four year degree super super important for finding a good job in this field? i have to ask because i often see videos from people like engineered truth or random youtubers saying you should follow in the footsteps of many greats who didn't get a college degree, and that by getting a college degree you're putting yourself behind for many, many years by taking on way too much debt just so you can get into an uncertain job market that might even be hiring people without degrees. sounds like bullshit to me, and most of these youtubers are making a career off of making scary videos about college advertising their life help lessons or codeacademy or something, i have to ask because some of the scary parts are working."

psa: the most effective way to negotiate is to actually turn down the offer.,9a3jql,blank,FelineEnigma,6,1535193760.0,"i recently went on a job search and got offers from several companies i was interested in working for. i tried following all of the negotiating tips i've read. i said things like ""i'll sign immediately if you increase it to $x"" and ""can you match my offer from (competitor company)?"" one company even sent me another candidate's slightly higher compensation package by mistake and i told them if they could honor that it would make the decision very easy for me. eventually i had written offer letters with final, post-negotiation numbers from every company.  after i signed an offer and notified everyone else of my decision, 2 of the companies immediately wanted to make higher offers. this is despite saying ""this is the highest we can go"" and ""you're already way above the max of our range"" before. they all knew what i was being offered at other companies, but didn't want to make their strongest offer without first getting confirmation that i was turning them down. in hindsight, i could've just sent the rejection emails first and then waited a few days before signing anything.  of course, this only works if you're really ready to walk away from the company. i've heard from multiple sources that the same trick works on my top choice company, but i didn't want to take the risk and was happy with the pay so i just signed it. based on my experience here and other anecdotes i've seen, i would guess recruiters at some companies have policies to make a default offer for some amount based on your experience, some wiggle room to try matching certain other companies or your current compensation, and a maximum amount possible they save for candidates who reject the offer. it's risky to negotiate this way unless you really are equally happy with your top choices, so that a compensation boost is the only deciding factor it takes to change your mind."

duped by a bootcamp,6ehozi,blank,unemployablthrowaway,42,1496290999.0,"i’d love to name the bootcamp, so others don’t make the same mistake i did. but i signed an enormous contract when i entered the program which they have conveniently scrubbed from their website and i wouldn’t put it past them suing/blackballing me for writing this.   like many millennials, i left college more confused about my future than when i began. my humanities degree was basically worthless, i had no desire to take on more student loans, or spend years in school. so after a few years of having under 100 dollars in my checking account any given day of the week, i followed in the footsteps of many of my friends and signed up for a coding bootcamp.   i say signed up because there was no real interview process, just two of the easiest logic questions ever and then they were ready to take my money. a few weeks later, i began the pre work section of my bootcamp. despite saying it would only take 10-15 hours a week, i easily put in 40 hours every week and had to quit my part time job. but i made it through and arrived on campus.   about five minutes into being on campus, i learned that we would have a test every friday morning and had to pass 5/6 of the timed tests to get the career services. i have extreme test-taking anxiety, and while i explained that to them, i was told the tests were required to graduate from the bootcamp. any previous knowledge of these tests would have been nice, as i would not have signed up for the bootcamp if i knew that was a requirement. i also had signed up for this bootcamp, because they were the only bootcamp in my city with a dedicated career services. as a floundering 25 year old, i needed this help.  so, despite working 14-16 hours at least 6 days a week, barely sleeping, gaining weight, and missing out on having a social life at all, i inevitably misplaced a semi-colon (or something equally dumb) on the 6th test. having previously been caught up on the 2nd, i was no longer able to gain career services. while i was extremely disheartened, i pushed myself to complete the rest of the program, as i still expected i would get some help from the career services department in navigating a new field.   well, here i am 6 months later. the few times i’ve reached out to the career staff, to ask basic questions about job hunting strategies, i’ve been met with an “idk” over slack. they took my $17,000 and cut ties with me completely. i’ve been coding and thankfully have a consistent freelance gig that (barely) pays my rent/food costs, but it gets more discouraging every day. i was able to advance to the final stages of a few interviews the first month or two after finishing the bootcamp, but now i’m lucky if i get a single phone screen every few weeks. i live in one of the top 5 tech cities in america, and i can’t get an interview to save my life. i’ve applied to jobs in basically every city in america, completely willing to relocate, but nothing. i need mentorship and connections, two things i was hoping to get out out the bootcamp, but i was clearly just a check to them.   the most upsetting aspect of this, is that the bootcamp emphasized the “family” aspect of the course so heavily, but that’s all just corporo bullshit. take the advice of a lot of the people on this sub: if you’re considering going to a bootcamp, learn this shit yourself. even if you don’t get a job, you at least won’t risk it like i did.   tl;dr: i got scammed by a bootcamp. don’t get scammed by a bootcamp. probably don't do one."

best way to ditch freelance and get a 9-to-5 programming job?,3hrifw,blank,mcknute,2,1440131718.0,"i'd like some advice on how to transition from freelance web programming/database admin into a mainstream 9-to-5 programming career. i'm specifically curious about what skills i need for the los angeles job market, and if i should get certs, degrees, bootcamp, or if it's at all practical to jump into the job market as-is. mainstream job-searching is new to me, so i figure i'd ask the reddit horde for some guidance.  long story: i'm 30 years old, live in los angeles, and have a bachelor's in marketing, but have loved making websites since the geocities days. main skills currently include basic html and css, basic photoshop, php, smarty, and mysql, in addition to some b2b marketing/networking skills with affiliates. i've spent almost my entire adult life (since stumbling into it my junior year in college) doing freelance work for small, local pr0n sites through word-of-mouth. that said, i feel like i'm a blank slate when it comes to a resume, or for what positions i'd even be qualified to apply for. for one thing, i have no cs degrees or certificates, and just two long-ago community college classes in dreamweaver and flash. also, because my programming is mostly in backend stuff, i don't have much in the way of shareable portfolio pieces (is there a github for upgrading sites from running on a simple xml file to a custom, searchable mysql database?). oh, and i'm a chick with asperger's, so i feel my resume needs to look better than most people's given the very real possibility of interviewer gender bias and of me not interviewing well.  i'm tired of chasing gigs, and i'm eager to get into a big, stable, mainstream company. i don't have much in the way of proving what skills i have at the moment, but i'm eager to prove myself and i *know* i can learn what's needed for a solid database or web programming career. i just need an idea of what needs to be done.  thanks again ~~~"
"should i pursue a degree in computer science (or it), or a degree in nursing?",3mv9zu,blank,hellomelove,2,1443582237.0,"so i have a dilemma here. should i go for computer science (or it) or nursing. and please, don't tell me to go for nursing informatics. here's my story: i failed out of nursing school a little while back. now, i am going to online colleges to get credits for different courses to put towards a degree. i haven't yet decided whether i want to go back to nursing school or whether i want to pursue something else. i live in the new york metropolitan area in the united states. i'm actually interested in the topics of art, music, design and performing arts. i'm afraid that if i pursue a degree in any of those topics, i'll be a lot less likely to get a job and taken less seriously by people. i'm afraid that if i pursue a degree in any of those topics, i'll be confined to looking for work only in a few metropolitan areas of the country. the reason why i originally went for nursing is because i wanted to have a flexible degree that i could take with me to any part of the country or any part of the world. before i failed nursing school, the plan was to graduate with a nursing degree, work, save money, and actually pursue what i wanted to to do in life, hobby, career and education-wise. anyway, i would really like to go for a “serious” degree that i can take with me to a lot of places and that is in demand. i don't want to just have a degree where i'm stuck in new york or stuck in la, looking for jobs that i'm not going to get that only exist in those areas. so, i have been thinking about either going back to school for nursing, or going to college online for computer science (or it).  ...........cons about job availability with nursing .............. in terms of job availability, hiring practices, and work environment how does nursing and computer science compare? i am a small, young white woman. i'm not a “whore type,” and i don't know too many people. i have almost no money saved up. i don't have a car. i am telling you these details because sometimes details like this affect one's place in a given industry. (for example, i've heard veterinarians say that they wouldn't hire a small person as a veterinary technician, which is horrible because veterinary technicians work hard for their degree.) there seem to be too many people going for every field, and there is so much nepotism—at least in new york. i also have reason to believe that some people area actually buy jobs. every type of job seems to be impossible to get these days, though some jobs seem to be more impossible to get than others. a lot of times, whenever i go to hospitals or nursing homes, a good amount of the nurses and cnas that i see are not white—they are mostly black and whatever else, which kind of makes me worry more about whether i'd be able to find a job,being a little white girl. (i can't check off on paper that i'm in a “historically persecuted” racial group, but i need to making a living and eat, too!) also, a lot of the nurses that i've seen seem to be bigger than me, and sometimes fatter, and my teacher in nursing school actually commented on my height and said i was “small and weak,” as she was teaching me a technique of how to roll a patient over. (she was a thin white lady who was kind of big) is that what employers will see when they look at me—a small, weak person who can't do the job? also, i hear so much about how there is a nursing shortage, but is this really true?  ......cons about computer science....... from reading people's comments on online forums, i get the impression that not every city has a demand for computer science people, and that in some places you can't really make a living doing this, despite the fact that supposedly you can make a lot in other cities. also, i can't help but think about how it is a male dominated field. is there a reason for this? is there are gender bias thing going on? of course, you always hear those encouraging words “women can do anything!”, but in reality, in some industries, the hiring practices and the coworker environments are gender biased. for example, a friend of mine worked in automotive, and he said that none of the people who fixed cars alongside him were ever women. the only position that he ever saw a woman in in the places that he worked was at a reception desk. my friend's coworkers usually weren't only men, they were overly macho, stuck up, brutish, crotch grabbing guys who talked a lot of trash. it was a stuck up, brutish men's club. my friend couldn't stand it, and he was a man. i don't think that that's a good type of work environment for a woman like me to be around. maybe there's a woman out there who could play up to that and thrive in that kind of environment, but not me. anyway, is this how the computer science field is, in a way? also, is there too much nepotism in the computer science (and/or it field)? is there more nepotism in that field than nursing? for someone like myself who doesn't know someone, would it be harder for me to find employment in this computer science than nursing? also i heard that the it field prefers to hire asians over anyone else. does that also happen in computer science, and is this a reason for why i shouldn't go for it or computer science? is computer science a hack industry where you have to know a lot of people to get in, or else they won't hire you if they don't know you? also, i hear people raving online about how people who come out of computer science programs find jobs so quickly and make an okay amount of money. how many people, or what percentage of people actually come out of computer science programs making okay money? is it just the people who know somebody? if i go for computer science, am i still closing myself off to much of the country or much of the world because of the usefulness or uselessness of the degree?  .....pros about nursing....... here are the reasons why i would do nursing: like i said, i could probably take the degree to more places, i've had this fantasy of just buying a ticket to another place and applying somewhere, if i couldn't find anything where i am. what i liked about nursing school is that i was up on my feet, and i was having contact with other people. i like to walk around more than sit down all the time. i got to talk to some people too, though i felt weary of the people who worked on the floor. i got a miserable vibe from them. it was still pretty enlightening and inspiring to see different people, and there were always little surprises everyday—like what people would say or the types of people you meet. this is what i miss about nursing, because now i'm just at home, having contact with no one and seeing my social skills stagnate and feeling a bit lonely. i'm actually thinking about volunteering at a hospital for that reason. having to shove facts into my brain about disgusting stuff like vomit, bowel movements, blood pressure, etc skeeved me out. i had to know about those things, but it skeeved me out to even think about them. however, once i got the facts in my head, it was actually kind of nice to know those things.  .....pros about computer science...... if i went online for computer science, i could have more time to pursue my passions and hobbies at home that i care more about (more than nursing or computer science). i could also try to find work as well (though i doubt that that will work out-- but i guess never say never). also, i am interested in computer science (and/ore it) because i think that knowing about such stuff is very relevant. i'd like to learn about computer science, especially concerning cyber safety. everything that we do revolves around the internet, and it's evolving so quickly. i would like to learn about computers. i've always been a bit interested in computers. i already know html and css. i've dipped into java, and i've dipped into javascript. it's such an overwhelming topic, and it's hard to stick to. i think that going to college for it and being forced to have a focus would really help me to learn about it. maybe i could make some sort of business out of knowledge of this topic?. the only thing is that i don't really like is to sit down and stay in one play. i also prefer looking at my surroundings around me in real life than staring at a screen. still, i think that it's cool to know computer info."

flipping from finance to computers...,3bvpiw,blank,college-cashier,12,1435879035.0,"and as a result, a traditionally female work force to predominantly male. i currently work in the finance department of the university i attend, which is almost entirely women. i have a ton of free time at my job during slow periods (non-payment times, breaks between semesters, etc), so i've decided to do something useful with at least a few hours of my day. my boyfriend just graduated from the same university with an it degree and got a job as a software developer. most people are surprised by it, but he has been programming for a very long time, and he is extremely good at it (and he topped almost every single class; graduated with 3.93gpa). i feel like he had an upper-hand compared to most of his classmates and even some of the computer science students he competed against. he works now for a software company that contracts to nasa (we are in the houston area, so plenty of jobs for tech). partially due to his influence, i'm sure, and because of how easily he got a job, i decided to teach myself some coding. i decided to start with python. so far, it has been challenging and sometimes frustrating, but i assume that's how any new thing starts. it took me twenty minutes to figure out one problem, but once it clicked, i got really excited. i like doing it. i like being able to tell people, ""hey look, i made this thing!"" even though it's ridiculously easy, even when people look at me weird. i dunno. i feel kinda proud of myself, which i've never really felt before.  i will be attending college again next semester. since i work full-time, i can probably only do two, maybe three classes a semester, and that's because i can study and do homework at my job (boss doesn't mind and encourages it). my boss has a computer science degree, so she's been kind-of like a role-model to me. i never see many women with computer science degrees. my boyfriend was even surprised.   anyway, my main concern is focusing on what kind of degree. i'm not sure if i'm the type of programmer who can do what my boyfriend does - sit there and code for hours at a time. as a result, i've been looking at mis (management information systems) because it blends business and computer science together. unfortunately, it's typically seen as a jack-of-all-trades degree. i'm worried that it won't land me many jobs at the end, though i plan to teach myself other languages in my freetime. note: i have no experience in programming other than the python i've taught myself. up through middle school, i was very good at math. not top of the class, but i caught on fairly quickly and completed assignments fast. when i moved in my high school year to an entirely different school, i fell dramatically behind in math. my basics are still shaky, though i'm doing some practicing with khan academy. still, i know that i will probably have to redo my first two years of college. i was pursuing a biology degree. in junior year, i began to have doubts when i realized there was nothing in biology i really wanted to do - i just went with it because i wanted to be a ""doctor"" or something.   i know that if i pursue mis, i will have to attend a junior college for beginning programming classes. i cannot go into these 3xxx and 4xxx level classes with no programming experience. i will probably fail and die. however, if i go into cs or ce, i will be even further behind. i have not even taken a calculus course. or well, i did twice but dropped it when i got too frustrated by my lack of basics.  i'm wondering if i should continue with mis (finance being my fall-back as many of the classes with one another), or go to cs or ce. this would require even more years of schooling. i know that some of these degrees are interchangeable, considering my boyfriend got his job due to his programming skills and not his degree in it, but i'm so terrified of wasting even more time jumping around majors. i need to pick something and just do it. i'm 23. i've fucked around and mostly worked full-time instead of just getting my degree out of the way. i feel like i've wasted so much money and time, and i'm terrified to do it again.  tl;dr: mis, ce, or cs. ce and cs will require significantly more work for me as i am not a traditionally math-talented person. trying to be a realist here."

i don't understand how to deal with disrespectful behavior and harassment in the office,a7h1q7,blank,temp1231156,7,1545207690.0,"**intro:**  so a little about myself: i have been working in the industry for a little longer than a year and a half now and have recently started my second job in programming so i'm not new, but not that experienced. i like to think of myself as a hard worker and as an above average employee: in my first job i spent a lot of my free time studying, coding on the side, i have often performed better than significantly more experienced colleagues (2 - 7 years in the industry), in my first job i was really excited and was fully dedicated to it, for example looked forward to working overtime since it meant to me more opportunities to learn. now i know that no one cares and it's best to just put in your 9 to 5 and go home, but still when at the office i work efficiently and care about the quality of my work.   **what i've tried:**  not just in it, but in general i've always found issues with dealing with colleagues when they're disrespectful, lazy, lying, etc. and managers have always seemed to be pretty ineffective by either not being able to control their employees - my colleagues or simply not caring, being lazy. as such i started early on to not be concerned with the work of my colleagues as long as it does not interfere with my work, though often enough this doesn't change much since there's either a certain maliciousness to the nature of difficult to handle colleagues or they feel threatened by my performance and actively start to hinder my progress. to handle these type of issues i've tried different approaches in the past. the first being simply to avoid conflict, do good work and hope that i can find other people with a similar mentality and move in to work with them rather than work in an environment i don't like, but this is rather ineffective as there's not that much choice to change the people i work with. my second approach was to be more aggressive and basically any issue i had with a colleague i would raise it early on with my manager and if that had no effect would escalate to the next higher ranking manager, which didn't change much, since after contacting the higher ranking manager, my manager would distrust me and even if at first they were on my side, now they wouldn't care or support my colleague regardless of who's right or who works better or if my colleague is incompetent. i don't really know how to handle these type of situations or whether once you start working with someone malicious you're just kinda stuck, i'm experiencing the same issue again at my present workplace and just don't know what to do.    **problem:**  i started work a month ago and my colleague started about two months ago. he is performing adequately his duties, but i finish up the same tasks twice as fast and with the same or better quality, ask less questions, i am more knowledgeable even though he has 3.5 years of experience and i always arrive on time, while he's sometimes late up to 5 min and with messy hair, unshaven (though this is minor), but there are signs from his side of inappropriate competition, harassment, however it's more difficult to prove and i feel like if i brought it up with my manager it could be ignored or my manager would just side with my colleague since i'd be bothering him.  basically my colleague has expressed minor insults over chat, tried to trick me in thinking that the working hours of our duties are different then they actually are, i suspect that he has been telling lies about me behind my back, i suspect this since once i walked in on him talking in the kitchen with another colleague saying:“how i don't know how i'm going to deal with him” and another when coming back to a meeting room how to a different colleague he was saying “i don't know what to do about the situation” and both times the conversation would just stop, he has said small insults such as comparing me to his girlfriend or similar and one time when i was taking a particularly hard test at work at exactly the time i was about to start taking the test he invited other colleagues to come loudly talk with him nearby, there are other signs, but effectively this is circumstantial and though there are other actions to add to the bigger picture, the nature of this type of harassment is more subtle and secretive so it's difficult to build a proper case. his motivation in this would be clear as i'm performing a lot better than him or he simply takes pleasure in this type of activity.   if i believed that he's a decent person i'd just talk about this with him, but i'm sure that he would just say how i have nothing to worry about and would just become more careful. or to raise this with my manager is more difficult since i don't have that much to show. i don't want to ignore this since later down the line he can ruin my reputation within the company or cause me to lose my job, promotion, etc.  my best course of action right now is to talk with the colleagues i've seen him interact with and see what they in general think about my colleague and talk with my manager about the matter but only express a suspicion, however i'm not sure what it would achieve. no one is going to just tell me that my colleague has been insulting me and neither will my manager do much about it.    **general thoughts:**  i really just don't know how to handle any of this all i want to do is go to work, do my job, go home, but it seems like no matter what, i'll have to handle some incompetent lazy colleagues and will have no tools available to deal with them, either i just have to adopt a similar approach and start trash talking them behind their back and such or just accept it. the working environment just seems to be enabling people to act maliciously  if in the future i'd get a job working from home or become a freelancer would i still have to deal with this? does this become less of an issue when working at a better company or for a higher paycheck?"
bad glassdoor reviews: how to better understand the work atmosphere?,5jrzl3,blank,csthrowaway1179,16,1482458666.0,"tl;dr: have conversion offer different than intern location, but lack of necessary interviews means i wasn't able to talk to many engineers about workplace, and there are many negative reviews on glassdoor for this office that cite specific issues with mgmt harassing engineers. how can i find out the truth about the work atmosphere, preferably by anonymously asking engineers?   i was extended a full-time conversion offer from a very large tech company last week, but my offer is for a different location and team than the one i interned for, thus i do not know much about this office (only the products they work on, which is appealing to me). i was able to tour the office, meet a few engineers and hr, and everything *seemed* great.  however, i now am finding ~10 bad reviews out of 20 reviews for this office on glassdoor (company has many locations). out of the 10 bad reviews, 6 of them mention a specific problem with a one or two managers harassing engineers and upper mgmt/hr not addressing these complaints.  i'm worried that anything i try to say to recruiter or my manager wouldn't prompt a truthful response about these issues simply because they want me to accept the offer. i **really** want to find a way to contact one of their engineers anonymously and try to better understand what the work atmosphere is truly like. a friend suggested trying to find an engineer on reddit, but i think the office might be too small for any engineers to regularly be on this sub. any advice?"
looking for a non-binary friendly workplace,7fmwti,blank,My8000thAccount,17,1511732047.0,"hi i’m an early career generalist (&lt;3 years post-grad) and i am also non-binary. i did not consider my gender greatly when looking for a job and just looked for general signs that i would be ok being out at work and have found the reality to be lacking. the company i work fo pays a lot of lip service to inclusivity but they don’t actually do a ton in the workplace to support their employees and i’ve found that i’m really uncomfortable with how my gender is perceived here. i’m planning to try and move once i find a new job (been at my current position for almost a year) and need some help finding companies to apply to.   *tl;dr do you know of companies that are especially supportive of non binary employees?*  edit: more detail from a reply thread   most people i work with are not familiar with the concept of non binary gender so they don’t use my preferred pronouns (they/them). and those that are ok with using pronouns then use me as their sole educational resource so i am constantly fielding questions.  what i am looking for is a company where i will not be the first nb employee, there are already some procedures in place to help trans employees (such as hr professionals that are trained to deal with lgbt issues and can help address inappropriate coworkers).   right now, i am having to spend an enormous amount of energy on my gender at work and i’d much rather focus on working."
success guide for beginner software developer/architect/engineer,e5ouwi,blank,cheese_egg_and_bacon,135,1575440720.0,"the title might create an impression that i'm going to list a set of things that will guarantee success. it's not what this post is.  i thought i could share some advice for folks who start their path in the software development or it infrastructure management and operation fields, starting with interviewing to actually doing your job. i constantly observe people missing opportunities and getting poor performance reviews because they're not following some of the advice below.  but who am i to give this advice? well, it's reddit/internet, i'm just an anonymous poster, so take any advice with a grain of salt. including mine. if you're inclined to believe what i say, this advice is based on:  -	dozen years in software development and architecture in contributor and management roles -	hundreds of interviews (as an interviewer) and dozens (as an interviewee) -	tens of offers received over the past 10 years (when i was searching for jobs) for high-level ic and ic/management positions -	love and passion for software development and desire for every professional out there to grow, develop and start mentoring  one thing worth mentioning: some (around 50%) advice i’m providing here was given to me by someone else at some point in my career. some of it happened a long time ago, some - a couple of months ago. what i’m trying to say (take it as first piece of advice) - never stop learning and never think you know everything. people around you won’t stop surprising you.  let’s just jump into the actual things i wanted to rant about. it’s not a complete list by any means. some things you might even disagree with. i’m just trying to share the patterns/behaviors i believe to be the major contributors to my personal professional success and that of other people working with/under me.  1) interviews.  -	please come prepared. read about the company. ask questions. -	if you’re doing remote interviews - be ready and check your audio/video in advance. get a decent webcam and mic. -	look at your resume. look at each word/technology. if i ask you right now “how did you use x?” or “why did you decide to implement y?” are you able to answer in detail? if not - get it off your resume. -	when you don’t understand the question - say so. ask for an explanation. stop inventing answers. good interviewers are there not to evaluate your knowledge of every pattern or every algorithm (if that’s what they’re doing - you don’t want to work there), they’re there to understand how you think and how fast you adapt. -	if you don’t know the answer - stop guessing, be honest. let the interviewer know and ask if they would like you to try and guess/think about it. -	talk more during interviews. when you’re thinking about the problem - let the interviewer know what you’re thinking and where you’re going with it. don’t sit there like a koala with mouthful of leaves.  -	a lot of you read “resume best practices” online and now plug in numbers/percentages everywhere to tell how your work improved the business. good for you. but please, if you have a number there, be ready to answer the “how did you measure that?” question. -	stop jumping to the code immediately. if you’re asked a technical question - talk abstract first. synthesize the problem down to an abstract question. think about real-life examples. let’s assume you’re asked to “invert binary tree”. don’t start writing pseudo (or real) code. talk about it first. draw the binary tree, demonstrate that you understand the question. explain what inverting actually does to the binary tree. -	show interest in general, about the questions, the tech, the people. if you get a question that you were not able to answer - go home, research it, message (or email) the interviewer/recruiter (you can always ask for their linkedin to message) after the interview with answers, explanations. -	if you got an offer always negotiate (unless you’re 100% satisfied by it). don’t be a jerk about it though. i’d recommend having at least two offers (or one offer and one close call) before negotiating. then you can be honest - “i really like the company, i’d like to work with you because x, y and z but unfortunately the offer does not quite match my expectations/market and other offers i’ve received. would it be possible to adjust the offer (by n dollars/with a specific benefit/add signing bonus/to match the market rate)?”  it’s worth mentioning that a lot of the interviews are, truly, bull feces and interviewers are asking questions they’ve googled minutes ago. it’s always going to happen once in a while - accept these interviews as “necessary evil”.  2) work ethic  -	never say that existing code/solutions/architecture is done wrong. it may be wrong/sub-optimal, but there may be reasons for it. sometimes getting a piece of shitty code out is more financially relevant than making it nice, solid, testable. at the end of the day - everything we do is designed to make money for the company, one way or another. that’s the main goal. not writing the best code or having the best coverage. making money and preventing money loss. -	code reviews are great and necessary. if you think otherwise - fix your mindset. read about why it’s important. -	when starting work on something (new project/ticket/fix/build) always boil your work down to a problem statement (literally, 3-4 sentences; like a story) that you’re solving. make sure that the problem statement is correct, run it by the requestor/peers/managers. focus on solving just this problem -	if you made a mistake - always admit it. make sure that your “i was wrong” or “i made a mistake” is seen/heard by everyone involved with the issue. “i’m wrong” is one of the most used phrases in my vocabulary. -	if you have a discussion (argument) with your peers about something (code correctness, architecture choice, solution design, etc.) - always politely defend your point until both parties agree. if your “opponent” convinces you that they’re correct - admit it. explicitly, state “i was wrong, you’re right” and thank for explanation. if you think you’re almost never wrong - fix your mindset. to add: -	at the same time never state your peer/colleague were wrong if that’s what the conclusion of your discussion is. yes, technically they might’ve been wrong (there’s no argument with just one party in the wrong and you know it). be thankful for their input and letting you to bounce your ideas off of them. confirm that they agree with the solution, thank them and move on. -	keep your promises/deadlines. this is easy to say, i know. but if you promised to do something - do it. whatever it takes. but most importantly - learn how not to promise. get a habit of making every deadline you commit to at least 3x of the time you think you need to get it done. you’re probably still going to be late. -	learn to pick your battles (it’s personal for everyone, some people are always going “with the flow”, some people are always trying harder - figure out what works for you) -	do not jump to solutions/implementations. when you have a problem and know just the tool to solve it we tend to come into the conversation with it [the tool/pattern/etc] in mind. stop doing it. abstract the problem away and describe the solution in common language. describe the “services” and “features” of the solution. think about the interfaces. only when everyone agrees on high-level approach start thinking about implementations and tools/patterns to solve each piece of the puzzle. -	see something - say something. if you see something that might be incorrect/inefficient - let people know.  3) software development/engineering recommendations  -	above i said “sometimes getting a piece of shitty code out is more financially relevant than making it nice, solid, testable”. that is true. but there are certain things that you should never do:     - stop putting secrets (passwords/keys) as clear-text in your code. whether it’s your code at work or your personal repo on github - stop it. interviewers do look at personal github repos linked in the resumes. if i see something like this in your personal repo that you decided to share with me - as an interviewer i will immediately prejudge you.     - stop hard-coding values that you might want to change in the future. use configuration-supplied values and implement best practices for configuration management in your language/framework/tool.     - stop making useless code comments and unclear/random commit messages. it’s worth your time to provide concise and detailed comments and relevant commit messages. -	if you decide to take a shortcut/not implement something/implement something in a “non-best practice” way - leave a comment. explain why. -	document. document everything. write more documentation then code. *edit: documentation is not necessarily code comments. architecture docs, guides, best practices, meeting notes, interface annotations, endpoint descriptions - all of that falls under documentation. basically the point i’m trying to make is: start with documentation, describe what your code/system/solution is supposed to do, why it’s needed, what types of problems it is solving (and what types of problems are out of scope); make sure to provide sufficient code documentation; write down discussion results and meeting notes to have a reference; if someone shares some insider expertise with you - don’t just use it, write it down and share it if it’s not shared already.* -	don’t assign blame. if you’re debugging/trying to fix an issue don’t ask “who did that?”. the only question worth answering: “how do we prevent this type of error from ever happening again?” -	if you’re doing something similar (writing the same code/performing the same action/triggering the same process) manually for the 2nd time - something might be wrong. if you’re doing it for the 3rd time - something is wrong. stop right there. automate it. move on. -	think outside of the box. when solving a problem consider involving other teams/technologies. the number of times i’ve seen people spending ridiculous amounts of time to do something that is already solved is overwhelming.  -	do not reinvent the wheel. if there’s an open-source (that’s important) library/module that solves the problem for you - don’t hesitate to use it instead of implementing your own (as long as it aligns with company policy and security/compliance requirements). but (very important but) go through the 3rd-party code, write your own tests for it if possible and always be prepared to fork it and maintain it yourself (that’s why open-source is important). it’s almost always more time-consuming to write your own solution but if you have to - look at other open-source solutions first for inspiration. you might notice patterns/solutions used by the author(s) that are better than things you had in mind. -	it’s a bit harder when the solution is a commercial product. here you need to think twice about the cost, support cost, expertise and maintenance - think and consult with your peers, other teams, procurement team (if you have one) to determine whether it’s worth the money. sometimes i’ve seen companies that choose to implement their own solution and spend a large amount of money/time on it to gain “freedom” down the road. others pick commercial solutions because they value their time more than actual dollars. each way has its time and place.  4) general  -	learn source control (git). learn it very well. -	spend time on understanding how and why things work the way they work. if you’re learning a new language/framework/tool - read all the documentation you can find.  -	if you’re reading documentation/book/article and see a word/concept/phrase you do not understand - learn what it is. -	learn general development principles. learn what solid is. learn what are the common software development patterns. learn when to use and not to use them. understand pros and cons of each. even if you’re a sysadmin, learn it. -	read all the release notes for your main languages/frameworks/tools. pay attention and understand major changes and improvements as well as reasons behind maintainers decisions to add a feature/function, use-cases for new features/functions and their limitations. -	take ownership of problems. if you need help/assistance from others to solve it - keep politely “bugging” people if they’re not getting back to you. don’t just let things sit there and get forgotten. -	if you don’t know how a certain thing works/might work - it’s very often more effective and time-efficient to just quickly test it. “what would happen if x occurs?” - instead of trying to figure the answer out by going through the code or trying to find it in documentation (unsuccessfully) - just try it. after trying it make sure you completely understand why it happened. i like to say: you should be able to keep answering the “and how it does that?” type of question until you get to “and then the code is executed on the cpu” or “and then the system produces a result” type of answer. that’s when you’ve gone deep enough. -	if you’re a developer, learn and understand the devops portion for your language/framework. understand how your code is compiled, packaged, published, deployed and upgraded. if you’re a devops/sysadmin - learn and understand the development portion. understand how devs pick what to work on, how they do reviews, what’s the branching policy. -	for any new system/sub-system you work on ask yourself these questions: “what happens if the system it’s running on dies?”, “how is the system going to scale with 1000x more load/users”, “how are other users going to interact with my system?”. -	stop over-optimizing. if your code/system works fine - leave it be. until you start noticing potential issues in your monitoring. which leads to the next point: -	monitor everything you can. if you’re writing code - think about a way of monitoring its performance. from the very beginning. if you’re building systems - think about all the metrics you need to monitor. again, from the start. -	backup everything you can. code - back it up (and use source control!). data - back it up. settings - back it up. -	figure out the tools/ides you prefer using (or you’re required to use by the company), read the documentation and spend time going through the settings. each single one. understand what they do. configure correctly. export and backup the settings. -	always remember: you are easily replaceable. as talented as you might be, as knowledgeable in a niche area as you might be - there’s always someone better. don’t try to “hoard” knowledge to ensure job security. it does not work long-term. be honest and try to make it easy for whoever comes after you. -	always learn how something works until the “aha!” moment ;)  edit: thanks for the gold, y’all. i’ll make sure to pass it down :)  edit: added “(as long as it aligns with company policy and security/compliance requirements)”  edit: added the “read all the release notes” item"

having a bad experience with intern manager,c3uvgv,blank,ExtensionSort,15,1561266984.0,"i work at a faang company, and i know this sub isn't always the greatest place for objectivity about that, so i'll preface this by saying that i really like the company's culture and way of doing things. with that said, i'm having a bit of a hard time working with my manager, and would like advice on how to do that better.  i'm working on a team that provides crash-triaging infrastructure to the company's mobile apps. naturally, we deal with a lot of system-level requirements, most of which involve different operating systems and compilers. fortunately, my area of expertise fits exactly into that, and my team noticed up front that i had a great background on the subject.  the first two weeks were a bit of a learning curve. i was too used to pushing 1k line commits and just saying ""don't worry bro, it works"" before pushing them, so i made a lot of stupid mistakes with their non-standard vcs that my boss got noticeably exasperated about. at some points, he appeared to be brimming with stress that he got from me. fortunately, we got over that hurdle and i stopped making stupid mistakes like those.  the third week, we had a 1-1 about the company's policy for return offers from internships, which are very specific. he stated himself that i was doing excellently on 4/5 of them, but had problems with:  1) quality of work - i push code really fast, and it's usually good code, but i don't present it well on their vcs for review (do things like linting on the same commit, so it's hard for people to see what i actually changed and what's just linting, and don't respond to comments on our equivalent of prs very quickly);   2) independence - i'd ask him questions too often, when i could have just as well looked them up.  i took these two points of feedback to heart, and got him to admit informally (we usually take walks to unwind from the job and talk about these things in between 1-1s) that i had indeed improved on them - i didn't ask him trivial questions anymore, and i was more focused on quality of work.  then, during the next 1-1, he stated that while he himself could attest that i'd improved, he didn't know if others on the team saw that as well, and that that would look bad on the intern review (the committee will be involving a lot of different people who i work with.) this set me in a panic for the fourth week, when i was frantically trying to do everything i could to look good for the intern review, and i ended up making more stupid mistakes on quality of work. naturally, this led him to tell me informally: ""if you keep doing work like this, extensionsort, then you won't get a return offer - i can tell you that much."" he identified that i had a good background and was perfectly capable of it, but that this was surely not my best work.  on his recommendation, i also talked to some of the other people who would be reviewing me. they said the same thing about independence, but remarked on that more as a side note rather than as a deal-breaker. i was much more reassured of my good standing and found it much easier to avoid spiraling into a panic under their advice than under his.  from here, it starts getting worse. the first incident occurred when we were discussing how to deploy my app. my manager, my peer reviewer, and another member of the team all discussed together how i should test my app in prod without being invasive to the existing stable version of my service, and i found it hard to get a word in edgewise about my concerns; mostly, and this might've been my fault, i stood there frozen and watched them make this decision between themselves because i was worried about looking stupid.  their conclusion was essentially to use a test system integrated with a ci platform different to the one we were using for deployment, which made no sense to me after i had done my own research and discovered that our current deployment system had an equivalent feature that provided more support for what we were trying to do. i tried to voice this to my manager, and his attitude towards it was ""i don't know how difficult this will be to set up, but it's your project, so you can use this tool if you want."" naturally, this translated to me as ""idc, it's your return offer to fuck with,"" so i just settled on his idea. mind you, from what i  researched, i still have no understanding whatsoever why he'd consider what i was proposing harder than what he was proposing, and he didn't offer much of an explanation to that point.  afterwards, we still needed to make changes to our codebase so that the binary built therein would use my experimental version of the service for test purposes rather than the stable one. i dug around for a bit, and tried to tell him ""if we just change this one-line statement inside this factory function, we'd be good""; he took that as further backlash against his deployment idea when, in reality, it was meant to help enable his deployment idea. he exasperatedly kept asking ""what don't you understand about \[his suggested testing tool\], extensionsort?"" and basically made me feel stupid for a bit until i was able to communicate what i meant to him. in the end, he agreed with me on that.  i recall these two anecdotes specifically because they're recurring themes in my interactions with him. i try to communicate with him, and in my fear of sounding stupid, which he amplifies, i end up miscommunicating and facing his frustration with the fact that i'm not understanding something that i previously said i understood. these situations, from my pov, always happen when i do indeed understand what he told before and am just trying to communicate something different. i don't have this problems with any of the other members of the team, because they're much more calming and give me ample time to breathe and say what i'm trying to say.  i've talked to a few different people about this, and the general consensus is that there are no red flags from my project history and that, as far as the weak points that i have go, i've been proactive in addressing them. sometimes, i doubt whether my manager is being objective due to this, but i really want this return offer and his words are a constant source of stress for me (to the extent where people noticed that i started committing to the codebase at 3am.)  i know this is a very specific and nuanced, if not contrived, situation, but i was hoping that you senior folks would have seen this before. mind you, there's no doubt that my boss is a brilliant engineer - he stands out from the rest of the team as that, and i look up to him for it. i'm just having a hard time intelligibly communicating with him because of my own insecurity and fear. thanks for reading this blob of text, guys! i'd love to hear what you all have to say!"
negatively biased reviews on interview experiences,dc7at6,blank,sergeydgr8,1,1570033148.0,"a lot of the time i read on forum discussions and here at r/cscq that interviewees were asked tons of leetcode hard questions and thus got rejections and noted down that the company they applied for has an extremely difficult interview. i've been noticing this happen a lot on glassdoor and leetcode discussions that an overwhelming majority of posts are about difficult or negative interview experiences rather than neutral or positive experiences, especially when i speak with friends in person about their experiences interviewing at the same companies and they've expressed anything but negative things about their experience. i've noticed this happen quite a bit with my company where the interviewee said they got a terribly difficult question in a phone screen when the problem was very rudimentary, such as finding the maximum depth of a binary tree or counting the max area of an island in a 2d array.  i theorize that this is due to the nature of review sites, such as yelp and amazon, that people mostly leave reviews of things if their result of said thing was significantly less than ideal or did not meet their expectation. but of course, those reviews are for material items or services, not for job interviews.  what would compel people to write non-negative interview experiences, considering that there are a significant portion of them going untold each day? i don't mean to reduce the amount of negative reviews, but rather to balance out the perception and reviews and provide more accurate representation of interviewing experience at companies. it doesn't seem like companies are asking people to implement fizzbuzz or two sum, but neither do i believe that it's guaranteed you will be asked something like finding a [palindrome closest to some number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/).  anyways, /rant after reading some salt on glassdoor and petty name and shame posts."
my mid 20's career change from finance to swe in 1 year,b47q12,blank,2cupsofjava,19,1553303955.0,"tl; dr: i went from slinging powerpoints and spreadsheets in a boring finance job to a full-time swe offer (60k, lcol) in 11 months through a combination of self-study and a non-prestigious ms program.  &#x200b;  i've been lurking on cscq for a long time and the posts here helped me make several major career decisions and played a big role in preparing me for my internship/job hunt. reading about others' experiences was a big help to me, and i'm hoping my story can help out someone else, especially if they are a non-traditional student or considering a career change.  &#x200b;  **where i came from:**  in my early 20's i graduated from a middle of the road state university with a bba and an offer from a mid sized local company for a job in the finance industry (not high finance or anything flashy). while the job itself was good and it paid well, i was experiencing bore-out after a few years. most of my work was administrative or repetitive spreadsheets and presentations. i started looking for a change, but realized i had not developed much in the way of  marketable skills, and positions where my niche experience would be valuable were few and far between. it's also worth mentioning that i became increasingly involved with the company's it department over time and was drawn to technology focused work.  &#x200b;  **the decision to switch:**  after spending some time searching for opportunities in my current field and not finding anything that i thought i would be happy with long term, i decided to look outside of my field into a new career altogether. i spent a lot of time reflecting on the type of work that i would enjoy doing and balancing that with career opportunities, aptitude, etc. i landed on software development for many of the reasons we are all familiar with including continuing opportunities to learn, career mobility, and job market. i was a bit worried by some of the ""entry level is saturated"" posts that come up on here, but they didn't deter me. i started self-teaching coding through books, code academy, youtube, etc. while continuing to work and researching my next step.   &#x200b;  **back to school:**  deciding how to make the switch was the most difficult decision of the process. i considered going 100% self-taught, attending a boot camp, a second bachelor's, and a master's. i think they are all viable options for the right situations, but i ultimately decided to go with a degree for the doors it would likely open up. i may have made a different choice if my undergraduate degree was in a stem field instead of business. after deciding on pursuing a degree, i had to consider brick and mortar vs. online and bs vs. ms. all options would take me \~2 years to complete full-time. the ms programs i was looking at required some college-level cs work, so i decided to start down the bs path by taking summer classes and then apply to ms programs. i did not find any online bs programs where the price/quality ratio was better than my local state university (my undergrad alma mater), so i returned there. i decided to go full-time student and quit my job after saving up enough money to do so. towards the end of my summer classes i asked my professors for their opinion and they recommended the university's ms program based on my goals and success in their classes. i took their advice and entered into the ms program in the fall. during this period and through to today i was/am continuing to learn other cs topics on my own. i identify the topics mostly through my reading here on cscq. i also practice some leetcode easy and medium problems for a couple hours at a time on occasion.   &#x200b;  **internship search:**  during my first semester of grad school i began applying to internships and i attended a career fair with a resume that listed my previous career along with my education and general cs skills i had picked up (java, git, etc.). that resume was a mistake. i received zero responses and zero interest at the career fair, which prompted me to take a different approach during my second semester attempts. i took everything off of my resume that suggested i might be a career changer other than my bba, which i removed the year from. i replaced my experience with a combination of school and personal projects, including details on the technologies they were built with. i also removed the generic skills section in favor of the projects, so my whole resume was just education and projects. i continued to apply to the few local online postings (needed to stay local for classes, including summer) and still didn't get any responses, but the next career fair was a different story.  i spoke with \~12 companies there and had much more interest than i did previously. one of my listed projects was an android app, and i was not shy about pulling out my phone and demonstrating it if the company rep asked about it. it's hard to quantify if it really helped or not, but i felt that they were generally more interested after seeing tangible proof that i could make something. four of the companies reached out to me following the career fair, two were big non-tech companies, one mid-size tech, and one small tech. i asked a classmate who worked at the mid-size tech about the company, and he gave it a good review and also offered to refer me, which i took him up on (shout out if you are reading this).  &#x200b;  **interviewing:**  i did a variety of interviews and assessments over the new few weeks with all four companies. both large non-tech companies brought me in for a single on-site where we reviewed my projects and discussed some behavioral questions. the mid-size tech company process included a \~2 hour take home challenge (allowed to use any resource), a behavioral phone screen, and an extensive on-site that included a combination of technical and behavioral questions, but no whiteboarding. the small tech company had a behavioral phone screen and two on-sites, which were a mix of behavioral, project discussion, and two whiteboard problems (leetcode easy involving array manipulation and binary search trees). my previous career involved a good amount of presenting, which definitely helped me during these interviews. speaking of my previous career, i did not hide it despite leaving it off my resume. i cited it several times during interviews, mostly for questions about working on teams and such. i don't think it hurt me at this stage since i had already proven my technical skills for the most part. i felt that i did well in all of them and received offers from all four. three of them were for summer 2019 internships ($15-$19 an hour), but the mid-size company offered me a full-time position as a software engineer with a salary of 55k. my ms classes are in the evening, so taking the job while completing my degree over the next year was an option.   &#x200b;  **decision and negotiation:**  i weighed my options and decided that the experience and compensation offered by the full-time position would be worth the stress of school + work for a year. that being said, i still felt the salary was low, even for my lcol area. i was confident that at least one of the internship companies would offer me more in a year if i were hired on after the internship. i sent the recruiter a polite email asking for 60k while citing local salary data and mentioning that i was considering other offers. they nonchalantly replied with a new offer letter at 60k, which i signed shortly after. some might argue that i should have negotiated for more, but keep in mind that i'm still a year from completing my degree and i did not have other full-time offers. i'm excited to be starting with them soon, almost exactly 11 months after i quit my old job.   &#x200b;  **closing thoughts:**  i know this isn't one of those crazy zero to hero motivational stories, but it's still been a wild ride for me. i'm very happy that i took the plunge and left my old career and i'm looking forward to starting my new one. there was plenty of doubt and uncertainty along the way, but i'm feeling a lot of relief now that i've been through some interviews and came out with offers. this next year will likely be a lot of work with a new job and two classes per semester, but i'm looking forward to it all the same. this has turned into a pretty big wall of text so i left out a lot of details, feel free to post or pm any questions!  &#x200b;

"about to graduate with a ba in cs - no projects, no internships, no experience, can't code, and can't write. what are my career options?",bkt0mi,blank,KrunchyKale,8,1557053553.0,"i got a degree in computer science, with a minor in german (and an uncounted minor in math because i didn't take enough of the classes for that at my graduating university). i did *not* get a degree in programming, nor software engineering, nor computer engineering. i had unrelated side jobs for the first few years (front desk secretary, field crew trail construction, etc.), but after not managing to get any internships, i'd been focusing on just trying to finally graduate for the last few years (it's been around 11 years since i started). i haven't done any projects, and trying to learn programming is so dull and unfulfilling for me that i haven't done anything beyond the bare minimum in that department.    so, why even get a degree in cs if i don't like programming? it's the major that isn't pure math with the least amount of essays to do. i am impressively bad at composition - i have a diagnosed disorder of written expression. and that turns out to extend to coding. if presented with something specific - a bug or line of code - in context, i can talk about it (usually). if asked to write code that does that same thing, i have no idea what to do. if asked to read a structure, that's fine - if asked to make one, nope. and when i do manage to code something, even if it works, even if i've tried to comment it well, no one can really figure out what i've written without really breaking it apart - which is not great for team stuff.    fortunately, a cs degree isn't a programming degree, and i seem pretty ok at the parts where code is not involved. i actually tend to do better than the majority in subjects like architectures, theory, and even low-level stuff like binary and hex mathematics or regex.   so, i'm obviously not going to be a developer, i'm not going to be writing software, and i'm not going to be a technical writer doing documentation. it's obvious that i would be somewhere between useless and actively detrimental in those sorts of jobs. but, most job listings i see are for ""developer in (language)"". what types of cs jobs *am* i looking for? how do i approach finding a non-programming cs job? how do i word that in a way that companies want? i don't expect or need to make a huge paycheck - my only dependent is a dog and i live in a very cheap area."
my journey and tips: 2.9 gpa at a no-name liberal arts college with 1 mediocre internship — 4 fte offers including fb,6278bi,blank,elliotbot,314,1490829302.0,"since i've gotten so much from this sub, i wanted to see if i could give back a little and share my story / random tips. hopefully it helps some of you out there. there was also some interest in my [preparation strategy while employed](  https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/622ceq/employed_engineers_how_do_you_allocate_time_to/dfj7tj5/).  **tl;dr:**   graduated from a no-name liberal arts college 2 years ago with a sub-3 gpa and 1 internship at a small local non-tech company; went to work for a large ""unprestigious"" fintech company, then an unknown startup; got a few hits from big 4 recruiters but always fucked around preparation-wise and never converted an onsite; fb recruiter messages me in feb. and i decide to go all-in; studied ~150 hrs in 1 month+ with a full-time job and landed 4 offers out of 8 onsites (didn't go to 3 onsites).  **disclaimer:**   i am not claiming that fb or any big n or unicorn or w/e is the be-all end-all of companies. i'm not interested in debating whether they're overrated. this is aimed specifically at people who might be interested in pursuing these sorts of roles, and especially at people who don't think they can ""make it,"" because of background, etc. i'm also not claiming this is a fully general solution. this is just my journey and what worked for me—hopefully it will prove a little bit useful for you.  edit: i want to reiterate that i realize my school and gpa didn't get me into fb, but that my experience and interviewing did. i got in *in spite of* my school and gpa. my title is phrased as it is because of all the questions people ask on this sub about whether not going to a target school and not having an impressive internship *forever* precludes you from working at a big n or unicorn. clearly, i don't think so and i aim to provide some context and motivation to those who can relate. if that's not you, then hopefully the resources and tips are otherwise helpful. (also quibble with the idea that 2 years out of ug counts as that experienced.)  **on prestige whatever tf that means:**  i see a lot of questions on here about whether it's necessary to go to a top whatever school, or whether you're screwed if you go to a public school or a no-name school, or ""will i ever make it to google if i don't go to stanford!?"". the short answer is: no, it's clearly not necessary, but of course it helps. my school was so small (less than 10 cs majors in my graduating class) that we didn't even have a career fair, let alone tech company recruiters visiting.  what that means is that you kinda have to make your own path. you have to do the typical side project shit that's recommended here all the time, but may also have to do a bit extra in terms of networking (few of my classmates now work at a tech company, let alone a startup or big n), keeping up in tech (reading blogs, hn, etc.), learning (moocs, small exploratory side projects), and your resume/linkedin/github.  other things i did to try to set myself apart were taking the initiative at work and putting myself on projects that worked on ""hot""/trendy techs (cloud, big data, ml) and maintaining a relatively polished resume and the like. even when i didn't have an interesting project at work, i tried to keep myself busy with staying up-to-date and not letting my skills atrophy.  re: linkedin/github, i got my previous job at a startup through linkedin, as well as my current job at facebook. definitely don't underrate it. i also had an interviewer at a microsoft onsite specifically mention checking out my github.  **on imposter syndrome, learned helplessness, and failure:**  last fall, i was contacted by google and amazon. i halfassed an absurdly optimistic study plan, lucked my way through to onsites, and then failed miserably. and i mean failed. i didn't even code a brute force solution to at least 3 problems. it was brutal.  the issue was, i was scared of failing. scared that i might do my best, and yet still fail. it was a lethal combination of learned helplessness, imposter syndrome, fixed ([vs. growth](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)) mindset, and self-destructiveness. if i didn't *really* try, and failed, well, maybe if i had *actually* tried, i would've gotten it! my precious ego was protected. my self-identity was safe.  in practice, what that meant was that i skimmed ctci, did a couple hackerrank problems in an ide, read up on some algorithms and data structures on wikipedia, skipped any problems that looked scary or intimidating (all leetcode mediums+ and literally every single graph or dp problem), and convinced myself that practicing whiteboarding was a waste of time.  now, i know this sounds pretty dumb. but i also know this resonates with at least some of you. don't fuck up like i did. if you truly want it, go after it and actually commit. fuck being scared of failure. don't preemptively discount yourself.  **on obsessive studying:**  in february, i got a message on linkedin from a fb recruiter asking if i was interested in applying to a data engineer role. i said enough was enough and decided to go all-in. i wanted to see what i could do if i truly applied myself 100%. i didn't want to regret not having done all i could.  i wrote up a study plan and schedule, resolved to study about 3.5 hrs a weekday and 7 hrs a weekend day, read a bunch of motivational stories (like this one aspires to be), told my friends and so that i'd be a shut-in for the next month, and hit the books. i kept track of [all the time i spent studying](http://i.imgur.com/vatijqp.png). i trusted the process. and it worked out.  as i expected, the first week was a struggle. i was getting lost with leetcode easy problems. wtf was a trie again? etc. during this time, i also wanted to up the stakes and not ""waste"" my preparation, so i cold applied to a ton of roles. probably over 150. i went through [the easy application list](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application), cmd-clicked every company i recognized, and applied to any and all relevant roles.  **on study materials and studying tips**:  ds&amp;a:  * leetcode * interview cake * the algorithm design manual * [arden dertat's list](http://www.ardendertat.com/2012/01/09/programming-interview-questions/)  system design:  * [high scalability](http://highscalability.com/) * [system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) * [hired in tech](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/55)  sql and data modeling:  * [mode analytics sql tutorial](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) * [kimball's the data warehouse toolkit](https://www.amazon.com/data-warehouse-toolkit-definitive-dimensional/dp/1118530802)  i did 76 problems on leetcode, about 75% easy, 25% medium, and a few high frequency hards. did all of the interview cake problems. had already gone through ctci, so just skimmed it. whiteboarded ~25 problems in total in detail (drawing test cases, iterating through multiple solutions, talking out loud about algorithmic logic and time/space complexity, etc.). did about 5 complete mock interviews with my gf (including the ""talk to me about your background"" elevator speech portion).  interview cake is pricey, but the cost/benefit analysis made sense for me. i focused a lot on quality over quantity, and it was a good fit there (big fan of the hints and iteration from brute force to ultra-optimized). the feedback from phone and onsite interviews was that i did a great job communicating my thought process and talking through efficiency and test cases.  another thing i got good feedback on was my level of engagement. prior to every interview, i looked up all my interviewers, any engineering blog posts, recent company news, etc. this made it easy to ask things like, ""i was looking at the recent announcement from [your amazing company], how do you feel about it?"" or ""i saw that blog post your team did on bigquery, what were some of the challenges you guys faced in refactoring your pipelines?"" i can't objectively back this up, but i do feel like this aspect is both overlooked and low-hanging fruit. (plus, shouldn't you be curious about your future company?)  **on stats and other interviewing process details:**  first contacted by facebook on january 18th. signed their offer on march 28th. 148.5 hours spent studying from 2/10 to 3/18. avg: 4.13 hrs/day.  8 onsites: fb, microsoft, yelp, twitch, venmo, foursquare, indiegogo, capital one. didn't go to onsites at capital one (wasn't too interested), yelp, and twitch (latter 2 happened after fb offer). converted 4 out of 5 (not microsoft; was a general sde role).  overprepared for my onsites with the exception of microsoft (should've done more leetcode hards) and fb (should've practiced more on sql window functions and pivot tables). if i had studied more efficiently, i probably could've gotten away with 50 hours. but it was worth the peace of mind, especially since i wouldn't get another try for at least half a year.  traveled to 5 onsites in the span of a week ([schedule here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/61e0t1/how_do_people_get_so_many_offers_at_once/dfe3ra4/)).  talked to / interviewed with about 20 companies at the ""peak."" some ghosting on both sides, some rejections on both sides. (somewhat funny, mostly infuriating ghosting story: aws s3 recruiter wanted me to apply, we set up a phone coding interview, the day of the interview was the day of the s3 outage (:/), nobody called, recruiter said sorry they were super busy (understandable), some phone tag, i emailed another follow-up, complete radio silence.)  received 3 takehome coding assignments. didn't do 1, converted 1 of the remaining 2 into an onsite and offer. spent about 20 hrs total on the assignments.  negotiated my offers a little with the help of [haseeb's blog posts](http://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/). added about $25k to my total comp. if i had another big n offer, i think i could've done better on this front with fb. ended up with a package totaling ~$185k.  **on useful lists:**  when interviewers asked if i had any questions, i stuck with a bank of questions that i believe went over really well:  * what first attracted you to [amazing company] and what has helped keep you here over the years? * what are some challenges your team is currently facing? * what are you most excited about regarding the future direction of [amazing company]? * walk me through the development workflow/process: do you guys do scrum or standups? pull requests? how are tasks determined and assigned? * what are some projects i would work on in my first 90 or 180 days here?  * what did you work on when you first got here, or alternatively, tell me about the project you're most proud of? * (to hiring managers/vps/directors) when you think of a successful software engineer at [amazing company], what are the most common traits that come to mind?  my mostly sorted list of heuristics i would go through when stuck on a problem:  * always consider hash tables (dictionaries) with their o(1)-ness. (""tip: using a dictionary is the most common way to get from a brute force approach to something more clever. it should always be your first thought."") * if at all array-related, try sorting first. * if search-related, consider binary search. * start with a brute force solution, look for repeat work in that solution, and modify it to only do that work once. * space-time trade-off! that is, for better time complexity, try using auxiliary data structures. e.g., do something in a single pass over an array—o(n) time—by using a hash table—o(n) space—vs. doing something in multiple passes—o(n ^ 2)—without using any extra space—o(1). what information can i store to save time? (another example: o(1) get_max method for a stack class stores extra information (the max at and below each element) to save time (instead of iterating through the stack o(n)).) * try a greedy solution: iterate through the problem space taking the optimal solution ""so far"" until the end. (optimal if the problem has ""optimal substructure,"" which means stitching together optimal solutions to subproblems yields an optimal solution.) * remember that i can use two pointers (e.g., to get the midpoint by having one pointer go twice as fast, or in a sum problem by having the pointers work inward from either end, or to test if a string is a palindrome). * if the problem involves parsing or tree/graph traversal (or reversal in some way), consider using a stack. * does solving the problem for size (n – 1) make solving it for size n any easier? if so, try to solve recursively and/or with dynamic programming. (using the max/min function can help a lot in recursive or dynamic programming problems.) * a lot of problems can be treated as graph problems and/or use breadth-first or depth-first traversal. * if you have a lot of strings, try putting them in a prefix tree / trie. * any time you repeatedly have to take the min or max of a dynamic collection, think heaps. (if you don’t need to insert random elements, prefer a sorted array.)  **on weird things i did:**  i used moda to help me stay focused and study. wasn't necessary, but it did help (big ymmv disclaimer here). didn't use it on the day of any interviews because i didn't want to make myself more nervous/anxious.  i copied over all the solutions i wrote for interview cake and most of the leetcode mediums and high frequency / notable easy problems into a local directory and pushed it to github. i then concatenated all these files and printed it out. took the stack of solutions with me when i was traveling the final week and looked it over on flights, etc. basically just priming my pattern recognition.  **on concluding:**  if you made it here, i'm impressed. i'm sure there's more i could write or that i forgot to include, but for now, that's it. ask me any questions you have and i'll answer every one!  also let me know if there's interest in my open-sourcing my pretty comprehensive workflowy study guide.  **edit:**  overwhelmed by the response, and thank you very much for the gold! i will clean up my study guide a bit and link it here within the next day.   feel free to continue asking questions, and if i missed yours, definitely remind me!   **edit 2:**  my study guide is still quite messy, but i didn't want to procrastinate and let the perfect be the enemy of the good, so here it is: https://workflowy.com/s/wgqavcpqfm  hope it helps, and if you have any improvements, please tell me.  also, if people want to open-source it for real and somebody knows of an easy way to turn a workflowy note(book) into a github repo, please let me know :)  (note: i don't use this account anymore and am not able to reply to all the messages i get, but if you need personalized advice or even coaching, you can try emailing me at suryc011 [at] gmail [dot] com.)"
"i've self-taught myself a sizable chunk of a cs degree. and now as i move closer towards the end of what i set out to learn, i'm worried that i won't get a job since i won't have an actual cs degree.",9mi8nh,blank,knkjnkjnkjn,8,1539056960.0,"i graduated college with a liberal arts degree with a pre-law track back in 2014. not that it matters in this industry, but it was from one of the ivy league schools.  i ended up losing all my interest in law by my senior year though and didn't bother applying to law school since i didn't want to take on even more debt for a career i didn't want.  after some soul searching, i decided i wanted to focus on computer science despite absolutely zero background. the only stem course i took in college was a blow-off astronomy course and the last time i touched math was in high school.  i tried looking for programs to enter, but i was in this awkward limbo where i couldn't get a masters because i didn't have any of the undergraduate coursework. but i couldn't take undergraduate courses because i already had a bachelor's degree.  i ended up applying as a non-matriculating student at my only local university where i had last pick on classes when available. after 1.5 years, they only put me into 1 course (the intro cs course) taught over the summer. it wasn't helpful. they then told me to wait around until the spring semester and they might be able to get me into another class.  i said screw it and started teaching myself using a combination of free online courses from edx, udacity, coursera, udemy, mit courseware, and random youtube channels. i also asked one of my friends with a cs degree to share with me his course materials from college and worked on completing all of the assignments, exams, and projects that he completed for each course to make sure i wasn't missing anything.  i made relatively consistent (ok, sometimes infrequent) commits to my private bitbucket repository as a pseudo-portfolio of undergraduate coursework.  in order, i have taken:  - intro to cs and programming (python) - object-oriented programming (java) - data structures & algorithms (c++) - two computer architecture courses starting with binary/logic gates, mips assembler, c, x86, etc etc.  i also decided to take a discrete math course at the local community college while i was teaching myself data structures since they offered it one semester and as opposed to cs courses, i couldn't come up with an efficient way to prove i've taken it without actually getting credit for it somehow.  i'm currently working on design patterns, then plan on taking another algorithms course and a course on operating systems.  after that, i'm not sure. i might call it quits and focus exclusively on side projects and interview prep, or maybe teach myself additional material in a more specialized scope.  i really have no idea where to go from here though in terms of career. i don't know if i'm even allowed to apply for internships since i'm not a ""current student."" and my project experience until this point is exclusively stuff i've done for these classes i'm teaching myself.  what should my next step be and what can i expect for a career? the more i think about this, the more defeated i feel as if all my hard work was in vain since i didn't learn this stuff while enrolled in a program."
i am finally getting an offer. how i did it without a cs degree (bs in it):,8xul5i,blank,old-new-programmer,27,1531295370.0,"i have a lengthier version with my entire life history in a google doc but i feel like that would be more for a book one day (if i ever become that important) so i will sum this up fast:  a lot of people make these posts in this sub. it is sometimes helpful, sometimes more of a humble brag, sometimes nothing worth reading. i hope this specifically helps those that are from a non-traditional background:  i am 30 years old. two degrees, one ba in psychology, one bs in it. i won't bore you with the trials and tribulations of my life, but i've done a lot of shit and obviously nothing worked out yet.  graduated in may of 2018 with a 3.74 from the university of massachusetts : lowell. not exactly a top school, but not too terrible.  i took all programming courses for my 30 credit requirement (continuation degree).  those courses consisted of almost all the java courses, c# course, a few web dev courses, and a required information systems course.  between all these courses i did tons of self study via udemy and reading. i try to read some sort of programming book every single day. for instance ""hmm i don't know enough about generics or collections. i know how to use them but..."" boom start reading java generics and collections form o'reilly.  i did and continue to do personal projects. i was part of the ""grow with google"" scholarship program for udacity, which was basically the first part of their android dev. nano degree. i didn't make it to the second part as i didn't finish the first part. i had to finish my last semester at school. had to prioritize my time. while doing udacity, i met a few fellow students in colorado that were working on a project. i joined that project. since joining, a lot of them ran out of time for it because of the second half of the program, so i have essentially built an entire android application myself, using firebase for a lot of the key components.  i built some crud apps using java, spring, hibernate, mysql.  **most importantly, i tutored via wyzant in java. this has basically made the entire difference between me and the next guy.**  through tutoring, i actually was reinforcing ideas in my head. i was sometimes learning new things. i choose to tutor for this very purpose. i could make money, while reinforcing programming concepts. double whammy. if he can teach it, he can do it (supposedly).  my resume was worked on for months. only when i started a/b testing it did i see even more results. i listened to advice on this sub and removed some things and it made all the difference. i took off my prior degree, only listed my last three jobs, and removed the quote at the top. suddenly i started getting a lot of interest.  if i could say anything about myself, it is that i know how to talk to people. i am not a shy guy in the corner. i come from the hospitality industry.  i am good on the phone, better in person. i've worked sales jobs. i've managed a restaurant.  use these skills to your advantage if you have them. a lot of times, people just want to work with people they can get along with. if you know enough, the other technical skills can be taught on the job, but being a decent person to be around can not be.  tldr: **how i found the job:**  1. ask for resume advice on this sub, removed things, changed things, etc. 2. sent out two different versions of resume to see which one was working. 3. tutored via wyzant. looks good on resume.  4. started applying out of state. 5. tried to put out at least five resumes a day. in total i'd estimate i've put out 200+ 6. tons of self study. if you are not from a cs background or a programming genius, repetition is the only way to go. constantly read, watch, and code. every single day. 7. learned from past mistakes. this can't be overstated.  i do practice algorithms on leetcode, i've read some of ctci, etc. all of these things are good and should be done, but not all jobs are going to ask you to traverse a binary tree. i sucked at algorithms but i've gotten so much better just by repetition. practice and keep practicing. i am only doing ""easy"" questions, but the other day i logged in and solved a problem in ten minutes. two months ago i would have gave up in two hours.  i don't know if this is of any help to anyone, but i know that for me, i liked to read about what other people were doing. especially those without cs degrees.  i've seen those posts asking if someone with an it degree can land a software engineering job. i've even made them. now i, and you, have that answer.  good luck everyone and keep powering through. everyone will find a job eventually."

i think my boss is a fucking idiot and i'm not sure what to do,6fb9z3,blank,myprogrammingthrowaw,96,1496656143.0,"throwaway because my friends know my real account.  anyway, i started working for this company 3 years ago, when i first started working there i had a really nice and intelligent boss who taught me a lot. he taught me that coding style matters and there is much more to programming than just having a working binary at the end of the day. for reference, i was mostly just doing embedded c, c++, and a bit of python.   however after a while i got bored of doing the same thing everyday, so a few months ago i switched teams. the new team was doing cloud development and i thought it would be an interesting area to get into. shortly after i joined, the manager of the team left to be a manager for a different department at my company. my company has extremely low employee turnover, they generally try their hardest to keep everyone (and they also pay incredibly).  the new manager was the senior developer on the team and basically started the project as a demo a year ago. he basically wrote about 80% of the code, my company hired a few other developers 5 months ago, and i switched teams 2 months ago. here's the lowdown on the project:  * the majority of the code is written in java, which is good in my opinion. * about 20% of the code is written in bash, mostly all the configuration parsing and deployment logic, basically everything that is not java is bash (less than  5% of the code is non-bash and non-java).  * almost every variable in bash is exported meaning basically every variable is global and the code cannot be made modular at all. * there is absolutely no coding style, almost every file is mixed between spaces and tabs. the bash scripts and yaml files tend to be 2 spaces, java tends to be 4 spaces and tabs mixed. the other files (perl, python, ruby) seem to be mostly 4 spaces, but depends on who wrote them. * i asked my boss about coding standards during our daily meetings and he said we're supposed to be 4 spaces, but he continually commits files with tabs. * we have a bunch of junit tests which we manually run for integration/regression testing (which is good in my opinion). * he refuses to set up automated testing using those junit tests because he thinks it will take too long to setup. as a result i have to spend a few hours everyday figuring out who broke the build. * the automated tests routinely fail for no apparent reason and i blame that entirely on his reluctance to actually fix anything. if he is able to run the tests several times and they all pass at least once each, then he considers that to be a good load, despite having various tests routinely fail. * the other developers routinely commit stuff without testing all the cases and which sometimes breaks my workflow, but i feel this could be fixed with automated testing and better infrastructure. * he merges stuff without testing it, which results in everything being broken all the time * he gets mad at me for not knowing stuff despite nobody having given me the knowledge beforehand. my other coworkers generally don't know enough to be of any use in most cases. * he has occasionally commit files after merging that are only partially merged (literally full of  ====== <<<<<), and therefore unusable. * he was surprised when one of the bash input parameters, that was input as ""var=$variable_name"" came out as ""var="" (i'll give you a hint, he doesn't know how to escape in bash properly). * he doesn't know how to write generic code, which results in him copying and pasting the same function about 20 times with slight differences. * he uses tons of magic numbers, never uses final (which is the java equivalent of const), never comments and rarely documents, uses strings for things that could be enums, and uses way too many public functions (in my opinion) * he thinks i waste too much time reading documentation and constantly gets mad at me for it. (maybe i spend 15% of my time reading documentation despite being new) * he doesn't like it when we try to improve our internal tools, since we don't sell those tools to customers and therefore they aren't worth making very good * as a result, our internal tools suck and constantly break which results in large amounts of wasted time. they also aren't remotely helpful if you do something slightly wrong (such as forget or misspell a parameter) which occasionally means digging through log files to figure out what you did wrong. * none of the internal tools have sane defaults, and to work they generally require all of: setting environment variables, changing a configuration file, and passing command line arguments * whenever he runs into any timing issue he can't solve within a few minutes, he adds a bunch of sleeps. this results in everything taking forever and occasionally still not working because he didn't  actually fix the underlying problem. * he easily works 80 hour weeks (because he works nights and weekends) and i feel he resents us for not working as ""hard"" as him * his variable and function names are mixed between snake case (function_that_does_work) and camel case (functionthatdoeswork), even in the same file. * he ""checks up on me"" multiple times a day (and probably my coworkers too) which results in me feeling anxious all the time because he low-key guilt trips me about not working as much as him. * he constantly rushes us, despite us being ahead of schedule as far as i'm aware * everyone else on the team works from home several times a week, probably to get away from him. * he constantly says the phrase ""time to market"" as if it will summon the god of capitalism or something * he admits there are problems but says we can fix them later, which results in me thinking he just loves technical debt since there is absolutely no plan to fix any of the issues.  i'm not sure what to do. should i talk to his manager about how horrible he is, or just find a new job? or am i just a big whiner?  it's worth mentioning i've only had great bosses before this guy, maybe that's spoiled my opinion of software development management.  more minor things:  * he touches my screen all the time despite me asking him not to * he points at my screen and says ""see what this does"" despite me not being able to see because his hand is in the way * he gets mad because i can't read the code since his hand is in the way (no i'm not kidding).  i think he's way too tired and he doesn't realize other people have a different perspective than him (literally and figuratively)."
physics masters to swe,9yvzwt,blank,LouisReasoner,6,1542774589.0,"i'm currently in a physics phd program at a top 10 school - but i had a drastic change of heart. i really don't have the will to continue in the program, and have decided to leave with a master's degree in physics in hopes of breaking into software engineering.  i have about a year until i get my degree and leave. in the mean time, in addition to working on my thesis, i need to prepare myself for the industry. so far i've done what i do best, which is mainly academic in nature. i've busted by ass to read through a number of sections of clrs, and have acquainted myself with most algorithms/data structures i'm expected to know (mst, floyd-warshall, dfs, bfs, union find, sorting algorithms, binary search trees, dynamic programming ...). i've also jumped back into sicp. thanks to some previous attempts at getting through the book, i'm about halfway through now.   my current plan is to do at least one leetcode problem a day, and finish sicp in the next few months.  okay, so here's where i need guidance - what else should i be focusing on? sicp will make me a better programming/engineer. leetcode will help on the technical interview. how can i mitigate employer anxiety over my non-standard background? should i make my own large projects and post on github? should i contribute to open source projects? how else should i be preparing to make my transition out of academia as smooth as possible?  i'm notorious (to myself, at least) for spreading myself thin. i can't do everything, and i'm limited in part by my commitments toward getting my degree (thank god my research involves working on scientific code written in c++). if anyone can point out what will have the highest value/time ratio, i'd appreciate it."
a new year's psa: please do not seek validation from this sub,3yu3j7,blank,NotARandomNumber,208,1451541670.0,"as many of you start your last semester or seek out summer internships, i can't help but notice this sub turning in questions about the 'prestige' of certain job, whether or not they should forgo any social/fun aspects of college to focus on studies/side projects, or other questions that mostly involve how they will somehow gain the validation and admiration of their peers.   all these questions, as well as answers coming from the undergrads who have yet to venture out into the real world, are honestly disappointing. the prevalent attitude on this sub is becoming more and more treating this profession as a means to end to be prestigious or gain some lofty standing in some city upon a hill (working at a 'big 4' company in sf). the future is becoming binary in that you're either living that dream or you're a failure in life. why? quit looking to this sub with the question that boils down to 'should i be happy in this situation?' the only person who can tell you that is you.   one of the easiest examples is the multitude of 'which internship would look better if i want to apply to xyz later'. suppose some anonymous person on the internet tells you 'oh, definitely take option a because i heard company xyz likes that better', are you really going to base a few months/a year of your life on the possibility that this person is right and you might increase your chance?  any experience is good experience, as long as you can talk enthusiastically about your internship/projects, an interviewer is going to be impressed.   the further extreme is obviously 'would taking an internship at a hurt me later on' when the post clearly doesn't have any other options. please, for the love of god, lets not have any of this in 2016. stop putting the cart before the horse and enjoy yourself.  as i, along with any other poster who has graduated, has said, any experience is truly good experience. you can spin anything into being a positive work experience. working at any internship will only help you in the end.   the same advice goes to full time jobs. there is nothing wrong with wanting to work at any of the buzzword companies that are discussed on this sub. they are great companies with some truly great engineers working there. however, there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the companies not frequently or never mentioned on this sub. if you can meet all your bills and live a lifestyle that makes you happy, what else is there? it doesn't matter if it's working at a small dev shop in a non-tech hub city or working in downtown of a major city for a top 10 company. do what makes you happy, the validation of the people on this sub shouldn't matter.   there is also nothing wrong with working at a company that might not be your dream job. treat it as though it was though, gain as much experience as you can and at least open up to the possibility that you might be happy there. you can always apply to other companies later on and who knows what the future might hold, but do not treat it as a dead end or a road block to your future life, treat it as an opportunity and take full advantage of it.   **tl;dr** the only person you need to be concerned about is you. if you're happy, who cares what anyone else thinks?"
walkthrough of one of my favorite interview questions,4kesk5,blank,cs_teacher,43,1463884116.0,"greetings, i come in peace!  here's a walk through of one my favorite interview questions, step-by-step, from the perspective of a hiring manager. i’ve asked this question to over 250 candidates and it does a great job testing basic software skills. i'm super curious if this kind of content is useful/welcome here.  first, the question:      we know that spreadsheet applications use letters to name their columns.      for example, the first column is labled 'a' and second is 'b'. eventually, we get to 'z',      and then 'aa', 'ab', and so on.      let's write a function that, when given the name of a column, returns its index. so 'a'      would return 1, 'b' would return 2, 'z' would return 26 and 'aa' would return 27.   let’s talk a little bit about these types of problems. there are systematic techniques to approach problem solving and our goal is to explicitly define them. that way, they become concrete tools in your problem solving toolbox. once you have these tools, if your intuition fails you, you can reach into your toolbox and see if anything can get you unstuck.  the king of all of techniques is understanding the characteristics of the input and output of the problem. this will lead you to ask clarifying questions and asking questions is part of the problem. the interviewer is trying to simulate a problem solving scenario. if somebody walked up to you and said, “please build me a website with a few pages.” what would you do? you would want to ask a million questions, right? this is no different.  so what questions should we ask?  questions about input:  * will the input be a string? * do we need to check the input for errors? * is there a limit to the input?  questions about output:  should the output be an integer?  what should we output when there’s an error?  in this case, i’ll say the input will be valid. that is, it will be a valid, non-null string with all uppercase characters a-z. the input will also be of arbitrary length. meaning, don’t assume it will be one, two or even three letters in length. the output will be an integer, though i understand there will be issues with overflow. let’s not worry about that right now.  ok, so we’ve got our problem, we know inputs and outputs. the next technique? solve it like a human. that’s right, it turns out we are human problem solvers and out purpose is to teach a computer how to solve a computer.  you: shouldn’t we be thinking in code?!  meh, we’re humans, and we’re still figuring out the problem itself. we can ‘think in code’ later.  back to the question. we are humans trying to solve this problem. there’s a column, we are trying to figure out if it’s the first, the fifth or the one hundred fifth column. let’s look at some test cases:  * ‘a’ returns 1 * ‘z’ returns 26 * ‘aa’ returns 27 * ‘ba’ returns ?  looking at the pattern, ‘ba’ comes after ‘az’ and before ‘bb’. so it should be one more than ‘az’. what’s ‘az’? if ‘aa’ is 27, then ‘ab’ is 28, which means, from ‘aa’ to ‘az’ is another 26 characters. ‘aa’ is 27, so ‘az’ is 52. so we see this pattern of adding 26 every time we go across. so single digits are easy, ‘a’ to ‘z’ is 1 to 26. ‘aa’ to ‘az’ is 27 to 52. ‘ba’ is 53.  let’s line up our inputs and outputs:      a b...z  aa...az ba...bz... ... za...zz aaa     | |   |  |    |  |    |         |    |  |      1 2...26 27...52 53...78... ... ??...?? ???  here’s a small leap we’ll need to make. this problem is a form of counting! when we use numbers to count, we know that each digit has a certain value. each ‘1’ in ‘111’ has a different value. so it’s the same with the names of these columns! so how do we assign values to each character instead of each digit?  with normal numbers (i.e. base 10), we know that there’s a one’s place, a ten’s place, hundred’s place. each digit in a number is related to its own value and a power of 10.      111 is really 1 * 10^2 + 1 * 10^1 + 1 * 10^0.  you: !? what if i didn’t know that?! there’s no way i could have never solved this.  bad news: you’re probably right. computer science, programming, etc, kind of assumes you know a bit of math. good news: you’ve identified a hole in your knowledge. converting between different number bases is something a lot of programmers take for granted. you’ve heard of binary? hexadecimal? those are different ways of counting. it’s fundamental to so many things in computer science. it’s one of things that i’m looking for in an interview. if this hole exists, i have to worry about what other fundamental holes exist in the candidate’s understanding of computer science. could this candidate write software? probably. will this person be able to innovate by thinking abstractly and creating generic, reusable solutions? maybe not today, but one day.   back to the problem! we know we need to assign a values to each character, just like we do for digits. except instead of 10 digits, we have 26 characters. since we need assign a value to each character, we’ll need to iterate over each character in the input string. so to compare numbers and the column names:      123 = 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0     abc = 1 * 26^2 + 2 * 26^1 + 3 * 26^0      so for each character we assign the value:     value_ofcharacter * base ^ power     where the power is related to its position. the left most character      gets the highest power and goes down from there.  here we go, it’s time for code! we are writing a function, it takes input and returns output. we’re going to iterate over the input, assign a value and sum it up. we’ll need some place to collect the sum. lastly, you’ll notice we’ll need a way to convert a character to a value. with digits, it’s a non-issue, but with characters, how do we do it? now it’s time to use one more technique: abstraction. if we can describe a piece of functionality, but don’t know how to do it, we can abstract it into a “helper function”. observe:      public int getcolumnindex(string col) {         int index = 0; // collect sum as we iterate.         int base = 26; // since we're dealing with 26 characters         for (int i = 0; i < col.length; i++) {             char c = col.charat(i);             int power = ???;             index += getvalue(c) * math.pow(base, power);         }         return index;     }  oh no, how did you write all that code? step by step, honestly. i am assuming you know how to manipulate strings in your favorite language; if you don’t, that’s a hole. however, if you don’t know how to use exponents, i’m less concerned. it’s less common and something very easy to look up. remember, if you’re stuck, you can always abstract functionality you don’t know to implement.  so far, the code looks good, but the power variable needs some work. we know from our pattern, the first character starts out at the highest power and goes down from there and we are accessing each character using the counter i. we know the counter, i, starts at zero and goes up to length-1. our power starts at length-1 and goes down to zero. so how do we relate the two? this part is another leap. indexing into arrays is tricky and as an interviewer, i want to see you do it effectively. there are a few ways to do this part, but the following is the most common approach i have seen. the power for a given character is length-1-i. did you make the leap? if not, array indexing is another hole in your knowledge. if you want practice with array indexing, write a solver for boggle.  in any case, the code now looks like this:      public int getcolumnindex(string col) {         int index = 0; // collect sum as we iterate.         int base = 26; // since we're dealing with 26 characters         for (int i = 0; i < col.length; i++) {             char c = col.charat(i);             int power = col.length()-1-i;             index += getvalue(c) * math.pow(base, power);         }         return index;     }  the last part is the part we abstracted: the getvalue function. some candidates implement it with a pre-populated map of char to integer or index into string that is the alphabet. others know that in some languages, characters can be cast as integers and you can perform arithmetic on characters. i personally love when candidates use this last approach. it’s efficient and shows understanding of a non-obvious part of the language which might be an indicator of overall mastery. below is my favorite implementation, but if the candidate didn’t get this part, oh well. either you know this part or you don’t, it’s not the most important part of the question. for you, however, it’s a hole if you didn’t know how to do this.      public int getvalue(char c) {         return c - 'a' + 1;     }  if it’s not clear, what’s happening, here’s how it works. we know we want ‘a’ to be worth 1. in languages where characters can be cast as integers, you can do arithmetic like ‘b’ – ‘a’ = 1. ‘a’ – ‘a’ = 0, so for our purposes, we need to add one. some folks know about the ascii code. this is an old standard encoding characters as integers. in the ascii scheme, ‘a’ == 65. so some candidates will hard code the subtraction as c – 65 + 1, or even, c – 64. this is cool, but less than ideal. for one, it makes it really hard to read for other programmers if they’re not familiar with ascii. second, you are banking on the fact that ‘a’ will always equal 65. if it were to change, for some reason, code would still compile but it wouldn’t work. if arithmetic between characters were to change, the compiler would highlight that for you. beyond the specific reasons, the meta-point is that hard coding values is asking for trouble. don’t ask for trouble.  we did it! we can now convert the name of a spreadsheet into it index. as they say, it’s the journey not the destination. so what did we learn along the way?  tools:  * understand the inputs and outputs – understand the limits, restrictions, range of the input and output. * solve it like a human first – when problem solving, don’t jump to code. solve an example input by hand and then go back an examine the steps you took. * establish a pattern – sometimes the pattern between inputs and outputs will shed light on the problem. note that sometimes the pattern is confusing. if nothing else, once you think you have a solution you can reference your pattern. * abstraction – this is one of the most important tools you can have. as a programmer, you need to be able to abstract logic all the time. sometimes by necessity, but mostly by design. we’ll talk a lot more about this, but this concept manifests itself all the time in so many ways. for problem solving, being able to describe functionality you can’t yet implement might give you the building blocks to solve the broader problem. once that is solved, you can focus on solving a smaller sub-problem.  holes we might have found:  * string manipulation * number bases (radix) * array indexing * math library * ascii encoding  want to test yourself on these concepts? try solving the following problem and email me your solutions.      arizona license plates take the form tcz2341. that is, three characters followed by four digits.      the first license plate issued was aaa0000 and the last one will be zzz9999. given a license      plate, return the remaining number of license plates that can be issued after the given license plate.  can’t get enough? try answering either question recursively.  really, pm me your solutions, i’m happy to provide feedback!  thanks for reading!  edit(s): formatting, fixed encapsulation to be abstraction, bz == 78 (not 79)"
"if i've built a few wordpress themes from scratch with fairly advanced functionality, am i ready for an agency job?",7l24z9,blank,IRAn00b,5,1513813226.0,"i stumbled into web development gradually and sort of by accident. my current role is essentially the ""guy who runs the website"" in an almost completely non-technical marketing department for a company of ~100 employees. when i came into this role, i inherited a wordpress site that was an absolute house of cards. it had been hobbled together by multiple different developers/consultants/semi-technical people over the years. wordpress itself was months out of date, as were the plugins. the theme was some visual composer mess, and they weren't even using a child theme for customization, so the theme couldn't even be updated/maintained without breaking everything.   i was able to convince them to let me burn it down and start over again. i built a new theme 100% from scratch. (and i mean that truly, it just started with index.php and style.css, and i went from there.) if i do say so myself, i think it's a pretty good site. it gets about 30k unique monthly visitors and it's pretty lightweight and efficient. it looks good and it's very maintainable. the theme relies on acf, and it's totally manageable through the wordpress interface. i've built a lot of plugins/customizations/advanced functionality as well. an example would be a repository of all our marketing content using custom post types, so every time we create a new ebook/webinar/infographic whatever, our marketing people can upload it and input a bunch of metadata. there's then a front-end version of this where you can search and sort and filter all of the content, which is really useful to our sales team.   the thing is, being totally isolated from any ""real"" developers, i have a hard time gauging where i fall on the spectrum. i see people who just download wordpress and install some plugins who refer to themselves as ""developers."" and obviously i do quite a bit more than that. but at the same time, i'm by no means a formally-educated developer. i don't know about memory management or binary search trees or sorting algorithms or any of these real computer science topics that i know *of* but don't know anything *about*.   i guess my question is, obviously i can use php, js, css and html to make a cool site that functions well and looks good. but can i say i *know* them? my wordpress installation lives on a couple of ec2 instances that i maintain by myself and keep up to date. does that make me full-stack to some extent, or would it only be fair to call myself a front-end developer? or am i even a developer at all, or just someone who's gotten himself in over his head?   i'm starting to feel strongly that i've outgrown my current role, and i think i could be earning a lot more and contributing a lot more value somewhere else. but i guess i just don't know how to make that transition. any help or advice would be much appreciated."
"when was the last time you disagreed with your lead, and how did it get resolved?",6qcxec,blank,Sven_Braun,9,1501385635.0,"to keep as much anonymized as possible, i had a disagreement with my lead about an operational issue that i had been slowly sucked into. what should have been a simple process has turned into a headache of red tape and non-responsiveness. i had been pushed into more of an operational issue (nothing to do with the content or quality of my code) that i am neither qualified nor comfortable dealing with.  to get to the relevant part, my code was supposed to go to another group. based on scope, it was supposed to be the full source code, so this other group could modify and integrate it into their base. instead, i was told to give them the binaries. for several reasons, this is useless to the group, as they cannot incorporate binaries into their existing code base.  i voiced my concerns via email, and confirmed if that's what my lead wanted. my lead confirmed and i proceeded. i still privately disagree with the decision, and i know i'm going to be involved in the inevitable backfire.  because of this, i'm wondering what was the last time users on this sub disagreed with their lead (or equivalent next-up person), and what happened as a result?"
is the emphasis on whiteboarding prep overstated?,60qph7,blank,IAmDumbQuestionAsker,8,1490162991.0,"whiteboarding isn't going away anytime soon, but there's been several on-sites i've been to where they had live coding, pair programming without much guidance from the interviewer, as a substitute to whiteboarding. and they even go out of their way to mention that they ""don't want to ask you silly things like binary search."" i don't think the backlash against whiteboarding is here yet, especially not at the gang of five or other large tech companies, but maybe for certain situations (for non-new grad/entry level jobs) you can get away with less whiteboard prep.  at least this is my reasoning for wanting to brush up more on domain specific questions and spending my free time working on side projects, instead of whiteboarding."
how important are cs fundamentals for someone self-taught when looking for work?,3nw8uo,blank,puddlerock,24,1444284159.0,"not having a degree in cs or relevant work experience, i've spent my time learning the skills that i think will enable me to build impressive projects, since that seems to be my best shot at employment. i've been going through some online courses on data structures following advice on this sub that a lack of solid fundamentals are one of the largest short-comings of people that are self-taught.  but let's face it. my first job isn't going to be at google. it will probably be with a company that's willing to take a risk on someone who clearly knows how to build things but probably has gaps due to lack of a degree. is it still a good use of my time to study things like binary tree traversals, or would i be better off focusing on building the skills that employers would expect me, as a non-graduate, to excel at?"
seriously considering pursuing a career in compsci,7xo9qo,blank,DrLoomis89,1,1518700288.0,"i've just entered my 30's and i recently finally finished my masters in geology. i had an assistantship so school was paid for, i have no debt. i'm living with my parents at the moment. been doing some job searching, putting in applications, contacting school friends. but i really haven't had the motivation to get out and get it done.  don't get me wrong, geology can be a great degree if you love it. but i got into it because it seemed like a good idea at the time. i read all these articles and the professors made it seem like demand was going to be huge for new blood in geology at oil companies.   but i've never liked it. i kept at it because i felt trapped by my choice, thinking my attitude would maybe change. went to grad school because i didn't know what else to do. and i was a great student for a while. then i got really depressed in grad school with just a thesis left and it took a couple years to finally finish.  i always felt like i had to force myself to learn, like i had to fake an interest. i don't have much confidence in it, i feel like i lack in a lot of the areas to be a successful geologist. i grew to really hate and regret my choice. i hate to be negative, i've always been really laid back. but if i'm being completely honest with myself, it just depresses me, the thought of having to cram all this stuff again to get professional licensure, or that i will continue to have to force myself to learn and stay up to date and fake an interest in a subject that just doesn't really appeal to me. do i just dislike (or at best, just accept) such a big aspect of my life and future, when i really do feel like i am creative and have potential if i were passionate about something. i almost feel guilty, like i'm entitled, but i just can't ignore everyday this feeling like i wish my 20's had a reset button  i was in computer science for a semester before switching to geology. the department was so crappy, our teacher for the one class i took dgaf, we just wrote code on pieces of paper and had to go home and figure it out ourselves.  anyways, over the past month, i'm taking programming i with c++ (started in pro ii, but it was tough for me to catch up). and i love it. for the first time in forever, i'm excited to go to class, i'm learning in my free time and working ahead, i'm flying through the assignments and finding my own online, already playing with arrays and the linear and binary search. i'm genuinely interested in learning more and becoming good at it. i have confidence for the first time since grad school. i feel like the problem solving and way of thinking is much more suited to my particular strengths. i got one of only two 100's on the first test (that's not to brag). feel like i would be excited to show and explain it to somebody, whereas i never felt comfortable or confident taking about geology   i was even playing around with the idea of taking out loans and getting my bachelors in comp sci. i already have all the non cs classes. and i'm not excited about the idea of debt or more school or the embarrassment and shame of telling people i'm back in school already. trust me.   but man, it felt like such a relief and weight off my shoulders, for a brief time, to think that i didn't have to depress myself by reading geology careers or searching those jobs or even having to think about it. a family member knows somebody in environmental geology who said to send him my resume, and my heart just sank. i feel grateful, don't get me wrong. but i was enjoying so much, this idea of starting off in a new direction in my life, with this weight finally off my back. i feel like i'm gonna be pressured or guilted into taking the job if they even offer, which i feel like they only would because of nepotism   i feel like the first thing i would do if i got a job would be to try and teach myself programming to get out, but after some time i might get overwhelmed or burnt out, that i'll just accept where i'm at and try to zone out in my free time.  i haven't been happy in general, finding it hard to find anything to be positive or optimistic about. programming started to give me that confidence and drive back  sorry for the wall of text. just venting and don't know quite how to talk to my family about it, or what to do. is it crazy to want to go back to school? would i be able to teach myself enough to be a genuine candidate, or would it wind up breaking me down? boot camps seem pretty expensive, would that be a viable option to give me enough of the fundamentals to get a foot in the door? just thinking out loud, but has anybody found themselves in a similar  position or have any advice?   thanks if anybody's read this far"
"interviewers on this sub, have you yourself ""failed"" on a question *similar* to the ones you've asked and failed candidates for?",62okuo,blank,multivites123,3,1491027531.0,"wording might be all messed up, but what i'm trying to understand and get at is: as an interviewer, you can ask ""difficult"" questions to candidates and fail them when they don't pass it, and subsequently you can fail at other companies when you're in the hot seat and being asked very similar questions.  so what does that say about the interview process? i read a blog a few months ago, i'm pretty sure from steve yegge or someone else, but it pretty much mentioned that it's very likely that a non-trivial amount of google engineers who have already passed the process would fail had they gone through the process again with another google engineer as their interviewer.  what does this imply then? my belief is that there does exist a rare amount of extremely smart engineers who just *get it*, no matter how difficult of a problem you throw at them. but for the rest? it's all practice. if you're failing your interviews, it's not necessarily about you being not intelligent enough, or some binary ""you either get it or you don't"", it's practice. so keep practicing! what else does it imply? it implies you can be a rockstar at interviews today, but if you don't get into the groove again six months or a year down the line, you can easily flop on interview questions used to be good at."
