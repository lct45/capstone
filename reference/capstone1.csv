ed67ci,98,that was incredibly shitty of your managers at amazon :/
ed67ci,98,"You're the first person I ever heard of who survived a PIP plan.  Congratulations, you must be amazing.

My only advice is to talk to your Doctors."
ed67ci,98,Try if you can work from home? My sister (not in software but still a desk job with a similar setting) worked from home for almost the whole 9 months. You'll have to be up front with your manager and explain your situation.
ed67ci,98,"I just want to say, as a mother of 3 - each pregnancy can be vastly different! With my second I was not as bad as you but I slept all day and threw up until the last day, was miserable most of the time. My last pregnancy was a dream, I hardly felt pregnant and the only issue was when I got too big to do my own shoe laces. So you never know how your body will react. It’s good to be prepared though and maybe you can be proactive and mention to HR your experience before and that maybe you could work from home on particularly bad days? 

Good luck with #2!"
ed67ci,98,"How are the policies around long periods of paid leave in general at your company? How are things like sabbaticals and maternity leave treated at your company?

Are there existing policies around flexible hours for full time workers?"
ed67ci,98,"Don't tell your boss until you're pregnant.  Not their business, and you really can't stop them from being shitty people.

I would do a little scouting and see if you can at find out management's attitude.  I would also recommend researching laws around pregnancy and FMLA.  Your Amazon experience sounds like a no-no pulled straight from our last HR training."
ed67ci,98,"You're not the first person to get hit with a pip after maternity leave, it happened to my wife too. She got a different job with a better boss, second baby went way better. Who your boss is, really matters. Are they in it for themselves or are they genuinely interested in helping you."
ed67ci,98,I am a woman as well and this got me nervous for when I’m in this industry. Are you able to stay home until the baby gets bigger ? I’ve seen lots of parents do this while 1 person works .... what your asking for is possible. But if you know you have hard pregnancies it might be better to focus on you.
ed67ci,98,"I just want to say thank you for posting this because as a young married woman in CS who wants kids, I honestly don't feel like I have a lot of people I can talk to or ask about this kind of stuff. It's been really helpful to hear from everyone on this thread and gain some perspective on what's acceptable and what's not, as well as what to expect and what actions to take."
ed67ci,98,"I don't really have any advise for you, just want to say that as a fellow woman in CS that just went through 2 pregnancies but in a European country - I feel for women in the US. 

Now I'm gonna go pump on company paid time!"
ed67ci,98,"I have heard that Amazon is a pretty shitty company, but this is some dystopian shit."
ed67ci,98,"You need to talk to HR and your manager.  If your second pregnancy goes the same route as the first (which is no guarantee), you need to have an open and honest conversation about your situation and capacity for work, but that conversation needs to happen before you feel your work sliding backwards again.

It sounds like you had HG during your first pregnancy, which if that's the case can be diagnosed by your doctor, at which point they can assist with writing you out of work, whether it's a recommendation to go to half time or to take some time off.

A good company will work with you so that you can get through it, but that does require communication.  Saying to your manager, ""My first pregnancy was very difficult and it impacted my usual output.  How can we work together to get ahead of that?"" would be the way to start the conversation and they may have options that you're not aware of.

FWIW, I think what Amazon did to you was shitty, and I'm amazed that your manager there had an HR rep who allowed them to put you on a PIP."
ed67ci,98,"Women often find that one pregnancy is very different than the other - you might not get so sick this time. I've never been pregnant myself, but have seen many sisters/friends go through it and all of them had 'good' pregnancies and 'bad' ones. So, I'd just see how it goes and discuss accommodation if it comes to that. Also, disclosing that you intend to get pregnant seems like an invitation for problems - even if your boss is a decent person, they'll start sidelining you subconsciously, if not consciously."
ed67ci,98,"I struggled with work during the first trimester too (although not nearly to the same extent) and also had some complications that almost put me on bed rest and ramped up my anxiety to like 100% making work extremely difficult.

My only advice is be transparent with your company about any medical issues as soon as they happen. The second you think you might have HG, get that documented by your doctor and let your employer know. 

Obviously, everyone has their own comfort levels with sharing medical (especially reproductive health) issues with work, but I had a lot more understanding from my team when I told them I wasn't just pregnant. I was having issues (I spent weeks 13-20 periodically bleeding and terrified anything I did would make me lose my baby). I also was lucky to have both my CTO and engineering manager be parents so that helped."
ed67ci,98,"My wife had similar symptoms and after some research we found a motion sickness medicine that did help a lot. Her issue was hyperemesis gravidarum and meclizine helped a lot. It’s very safe to take during the whole pregnancy and when breastfeeding.
Maybe it will help you alleviate the symptoms if you go through something similar again."
ed67ci,98,Well thats probably one downside of working in IT in the US.
ed67ci,98,"It's my experience that a PIP isn't retaliatory so much as it is management's HR-advised way to proceed with termination. It's right up there with ""I need you to document every task you do and how much time it takes you to do them"", signs of a hostile work environment. It should be taken as a heads up that you are in the barrel (though really you ought to know politically where you stand anywhere, at any time)."
ed67ci,98,What state are you in? In MA we just had a law signed (that doesn't take effect until 2021) where you can get up to something like six months medical leave for pregnancy (plus 12 weeks after giving birth). I'd talk to your company but also check your policies.
ed67ci,98,"I would recommend you look into taking advantage of FMLA as soon as you think you may have any issues that will lead to lost time. Often people use FMLA to take a block of time away for various procedures, but you are allowed to take up to a cumulative 12 weeks off in a rolling 12 month period. Get a note from your doctor and inform your manager and HR team that you're invoking FMLA for any missed time. 

As a manager I once had an employee who was missing a lot of work and coming in 1-2 hours late consistently, I had a PIP ready to go when this employee invoked FMLA for a condition I was not aware of. What was really interesting is that this person was able to use FMLA time to account for hours missed due to tardiness. I had to keep track of how many hours this person was missing each week and monitor how much of the 12 weeks was used up. I'm not sure exactly how the law is structured, but this is how our HR and legal team advised me to treat the situation.

I would think most managers and HR teams would be reluctant to take disciplinary action against an employee who was on record using FMLA for any kind of medical issue. There would certainly be strong grounds for a lawsuit which most companies try very hard to avoid.

Hope that is helpful, and best of luck with your family!"
ed67ci,98,I just heard a podcast about gender pay gap and how women have to choose between having children and their career. Interesting listen if you have some time https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/the-pay-check-what-having-kids-does-to-women-s-pay?srnd=the-paycheck
ed67ci,98,"Try arranging a flexible work thing (work from home for 3 or 4 days a week) or something like that 

You can also hop ship to a company that has a flexible work culture.  My company in Chicago has a great flexible work thing, but it would almost certainly be a pay cut.   I imagine that is the case for most opportunities compared to Amazon, unfortunately."
ed67ci,98,"Where the ""Name and Shame"" post at? 

Jokes aside, does it even make sense to ask Reddit about this? I think this is completely dependent on your manager and your new company? 

Also, note, underperforming is....and has always been subjective, even at Amazon. :P"
ed67ci,98,"Unpopular opinion here, but as a male who would have to show every day do his job, and not leave due to sickness, because well I can't get pregnant, then not be up for a promotion, how is that fair? Starting a family requires sacrifice; your career will suffer. Being put on a PIP wasn't right but you can't expect to get pregnant and have everything remain the same. Pregnancy is a risk that requires you to give up certain things e.g., a promotion.

Now I am sure the downvotes are coming because as a man I've never had to give anything up.

During my wife's pregnancy, I was selected to be a Naval Officer (SWO), though that job would have put me out to see 6 - 9 months out of the year for the first four years. I turned that down as it wasn't fair to my wife or child. Since I was currently active duty, this made my life hell at work, since I turned down a major promotion, but it was better for my family.

Second child, I was accepted to due to PhD in Economics or Mathematics (had my choice which to pursue). Well after looking at the stipend and any extra money we could bring in, I had to turn that down, as the financial situation (without taking on debt) would be dire for a family of four. Now there weren't any repercussions here as before but it had been a goal of mine since I was a child that I had to give up because of my family.

Having children will require to miss out on opportunities, either due to your choices or how others perceive you - you will be treated differently because you have children. Nothing remains the same after kids, there will be discrimination and at times praise, it is apart of life."
ed67ci,98,Slow down on the kids train if you want your career to go anywhere. It is what it is... you want to get promoted? You better work better than others. And being pregnant for 9 months ain’t gonna help. These two things don’t go together; get your priorities straight.

eoym2c,16,Let's say you look back at your life when you're 80. What would you regret more; not having a baby or not having made the switch to a development career?
eoym2c,16,"Better to get some/most of school done first even if you have to take a sabbatical. 

Would you rather need to finish up in a couple years if baby becomes too much (and unless your partner is planning to step up and do most of the hands-on, they probably will be)?

Or start from the beginning in a few years?

If this is what you want, why would you learn zero now when you could at worst learn some now and some later?"
eoym2c,16,"4 years from now you can still make the career change, can’t say the same about having a baby."
eoym2c,16,"What do you want more? If you need to choose between never have a kid or never become a developer, what would you prefer? If having a baby is more important, I would start with pregnancy first. There is no significant difference for career perspectives, when do you start - in 37 or 40.

What I personally wouldn't try is to chase both paths simultaneously. Pregnancy and sleep deprivation can affect your ability to learn new things drastically."
e7y1wp,4,"Upwork.com, freelancer.com, guru.com, fiver.com, LinkedIn, local meetups"
e7y1wp,4,"I’m looking as well, where did you meet the designer?"
e7y1wp,4,"100% networking - and not in the corporate speed dating way or blasting everyone possible on LinkedIn. Most of my work as a freelancer was from previous classmates/coworkers who were on teams/knew of teams in their org that couldn't justify another full-time hire, but needed more people on specific projects. After that if I didn't have enough work I'd spend some time every other day or so reaching out to small companies or technical managers/leads just to chat about their work, and if it went well enough see if they had anything I could help with. It helps to be genuinely interested even if they don't have room for you, they'll remember it if anything does come up.

If those go successfully, word of mouth or repeat work will get you more than you can handle if you're in even a minor tech hub. It becomes more about maintaining connections than making new ones, but if you keep up with people even as you both move from company to company you have many more options...the worst part is that you have to start doing that a long while before shifting to freelance if you want to do it fulltime."
arglk4,28,"Do the internship. They are not allowed to fire you based on pregnancy. 

It’s not going to be easy, find the support of older parent engineers there and make friends with them.

"
arglk4,28,Do the internship.
arglk4,28,"It’s not that complicated :) you killed the interview and got the internship. While being pregnant will come with its own challenges (lots of women are in my office) you can still be a great intern. There is absolutely no reason for you to back out. You’ll learn a lot! It may be hard at times, but I definitely suggest doing it even if you feel nervous. It will really help you get a job later on. "
arglk4,28,"if your husband can't help a lot financially then he should help more with taking care of the baby. it's only fair, since you have to be the bread earner in a tough financial situation. assuming he can take some of the parenting load off your plate, no one has to know about your new born when you look for a job in december. "
arglk4,28,"You are currently in school, with an internship for the summer.  You will be going back to school in the fall and graduating in Dec 2019.  You are expecting a child in October 2019.   

Having a baby & caring for an infant is an important & challenging endeavor that takes quite a lot of time & energy.  It will require time off for labor, delivery, recovery.  Late nights & early morning crying & feeding, post-natal hormones, and the physical stress on your body.  

If school is challenging and will take a lot of time & energy, it may be very hard to graduate by December 2019.  In the USA, mothers get 6 weeks off work.  In all other developed countries, mothers get more time off (often 6 to 12 months).  

"
arglk4,28,"I'm assuming you're American. If not, I'm assuming you live somewhere with less barbaric employment laws. Either way, I'm sure family status is a protected class for you. So, in theory people cannot discriminate against you based upon your pregnancy, newborn, whatever. That's in theory. In practice, a not completely brain dead manager *CAN* discriminate against you. I can just say you lacked attention to detail during the interview or something along those lines. Will employers do this? Some absolutely will but there's no way to predict who will and who won't.

Is it awkward to have a pregnant intern/employee/contractor/whatever? No. It's a normal part of life. The awkward part might be how much attention you get because of it. People will ask you lots of questions and be interested in you. If you impress people during your internship they may give you a full time offer.

I'm not sure what delaying your graduation will do for you? You say you need a job. But delaying your graduation date will not help that, at all. Can you elaborate on your thought process?"
arglk4,28,"Congrats on the baby ma'am, I hope you have a smooth and healthy process. If you can physically do the internship i'd go for it. Best case scenario you get return offer and start working idk like in december or january or however long it takes you to recover as well as taking care of your baby. Worst case you don't get the return offer and just look for a new job"
arglk4,28,"Good luck. No one else mentioned it, but you can take up to 12 weeks off without pay through FMLA where the employer has to hold your job."
arglk4,28,"Hey, good luck. A lot of women at my work place have had kids in the 4 years I’ve been there (estimated 15 kids for a 100 person company). A lot of them have an easy pregnancy, and for some it’s difficult. I’ve noticed that it can be exhausting and hard on your body (for some), so don’t feel you need to push yourself to make up for an obvious belly. Sounds like you’ve lined up your support system, just talk with them about help around the house/meals so you can rest a lot after work and come in refreshed. Plan to sleep extra hours at night.  This might not sound like work advice, but it sets you up to help manage stress if you’re sleeping and eating well. Good luck!"
arglk4,28,"do the internship. if anyone says anything report to HR immediately. I doubt anyone will care. I work with lots of pregnant women. I am 44. I need women making babies so your kids can pay my social security. So keep up the good work! 

delaying graduation just costs you money right? Can you go to class in the fall if your having a baby? yes. Graduate. You can look for full time employment while pregnant. You will be back from maternity leave by the time you graduate. 

do not let this stop you working. 

"
arglk4,28,Is this in the US?
arglk4,28,"Hey! [I was a pregnant intern](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/622ddy/interning_while_pregnant/)! 

I did an internship at Amazon two summers ago up until my 34th week of pregnancy. Got a return offer too. I remember freaking out about Amazon and being pregnant but everything turned out fine and Amazon was really accommodating.  I spent the summer away from my husband which sucked but he was able to visit and we even did some childcare classes while he was there.

 Really the only annoying thing was finding prenatal health care, as doctors listed under my insurance provider weren't correctly labeled as OBs or even taking new patients. In one case I accidentally called an abortion clinic. 😂 It all worked out in the end though and I was able to come back after the end of my internship and pick up where I left off with my old OB.

I will say everyone's pregnancy is different and how tired you are or how much morning sickness you have will vary. I had none of the latter and very little of the former which definitely helped me finished my internship on a high note.

I will give a word of warning with regards to graduation dates.  I graduated on time but only because I dropped down to the one required class I had left and also got the syllabus before the baby arrived so I could get as much done as possible. Babies are similar to pregnancies in that they can vary wildly: Some babies are super chill, don't mind laying in a swing for hours, sleep and feed like a dream. Other babies (like mine) hate everything and will only sleep while being held. Babies like those can make it very difficult to get anything done. You may not have time for a full course load and may need to push back your graduation date. Just take it one day at a time and everything will turn out ok. Good luck!"
arglk4,28,"No experience in your shoes, but as a December grad in a lower cost of living area, who didn't start looking for jobs until January 1st because I was actually graduating a semester early, here is my experience:

Most HR people won't reply to you till mid-January unless it's a crisis hire. I didn't get my first offer until the end of January, and I'm still looking because of personal reasons. 

Had I been able to start applying in September, I would say I could have easily been employed upon Graduation, but also my final semester gave me a LOT of valuable experience that's helped me in interviews. 

Best of luck to you!

"
agoapd,11,"Have a friend who did this as an SE. Think it turned out just fine. She wound up with several offers (and accepted one) 5 to 6 months ahead of her due date (iirc).


Another friend who is in software sales also joined a company ~6-7 months ahead of her due date. Don't believe there were any issues here either.


On the husband's side, another friend switched jobs (PM side of house) ~2 months before the birth of their child. In his case I think he took 2-3 weeks off, went back to his work to wrap a project for another month or so, then went back on leave for another 3-4 weeks or something like that.


Birth is a part of life, so why not see what's out there?


I would understand your aversion to changing jobs if they were like ""we have deadline x at date y"" and date y happened to be at or near the due date, but even then I believe US law (if you are in the US) would preclude any form of discrimination; would be a personal decision up to you at that point."
agoapd,11,"Double check the EI/maternity leave requirements for your province.

It would suck to change companies before your baby is born, and accidentally disqualify from receiving all your possible benefits."
agoapd,11,"My wife, who is a software dev, had our baby 3 months into her current job. She would say not to worry. NYC though."
agoapd,11,"This is what I found on Google searching for FMLA requirements:

>FMLA eligibility requires the following criteria: The employee must have been employed with the company for 12 months. The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of FMLA leave. The employer is one who employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the worksite.

Can someone confirm if this means that OP would not be covered by FMLA if she doesn't work for her new company for at least 1 year? If so then it is likely up to the employer's discretion whether they provide maternity leave."
agoapd,11,How would anyone even know?  
622ddy,35,I don't really know. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to tell them. And that if you schedule all your appointments during lunch time or early morning it's really none of their concern. Also if your internship is at a well known place then I'm positive they would support you. 
622ddy,35,"In case you weren't aware, it is illegal for employers in the US to discriminate based on pregnancy and childbirth.  You are welcome to keep this information private, but if it gets it, you should not be treated any differently. Second, in all of my internships, I had no trouble taking time off (in fact, I was often able to sneak away and no one ever noticed.) If you mention you have medical appointments for those dates and times, I'm extremely confident you'll be fine."
622ddy,35,"As a dev who works with our interns, and doesn't actually make any decision to hire them, I'd say dont mention it. I don't really see a reason. I dont see your situation as any different then someone with a different issue that will take 4 planned (and maybe some more unplanned) days off in an internship, which is... not really all that unusual. That, and when you do take the days, I dont know why and I dont need or want to know why. Keep it between you and manager and just keep me informed when you're going to be out but I'm expecting some work time with you. Thats about it!"
622ddy,35,You aren't obligated to tell them especially if no special accommodations are necessary! Let the roommate know ahead of time if you feel it's necessary and would affect her in any way. Good luck! 
622ddy,35,I would say it's none of the their business! Especially since this is just an internship in the first place.
622ddy,35,"Congratz! I'm currently at 14w myself. 

I really see no reason to tell them in advance. It should not affect them other than a few doctor's appointments. You will be gone before maternity leave starts in civilized countries. I don't see anything to be gained from telling them, and I agree with your worries that you might encounter negative consequences. (Source: have been asked if I was pregnant while interviewing. Yes, I know that is illegal.). "
622ddy,35,"They can't legally rescind anything based on your current medical ""condition.""  I'm a father of 3 so I use that term with the utmost respect.  Congratulations!  

The only real reason to inform them ahead of time is if you're going to be leaving for maternity leave during your internship.  That's obviously a significant change for them, but still can't legally effect your start date.  If it's just doctors visits and such that you're concerned about I wouldn't worry about it.  Show up pregnant... it'll be pretty obvious.  Inform your boss as soon as you know of times you need to take off or juggle around.  

Every employee of mine has medical stuff come up.  Yours are no different.  If you end up with a manager that thinks they are, you have a lot of legal options and should contact HR immediately.  I doubt you'll run into that though.  Respectable companies have significant HR training around this exact thing.  "
622ddy,35,"Big4 companies definitely don't want the bad press of rescinding an offer to an intern because she was pregnant - press would be brutal over that kind of thing, especially with how all of them are trying to be more inclusive of women and minorities in tech.

IMO unless you just don't want people to know you should absolutely tell your recruiter, the company can probably do things to help you out. You also probably don't need to worry about appointment times so much, as long as you are there for meetings and getting your work done, hours aren't usually super strict. ""I'm pregnant and need to go to the doctor"" is a super reasonable request, and you probably even have some allocated sick days should you need them. "
622ddy,35,Don't tell anyone if they don't ask. Legally it shouldn't matter but there's little stopping them from pulling an excuse from their asses to fire you.
622ddy,35,"I'm still in school myself so I'm unfit to answer this question, however I just wanted to say CONGRATULATIONS. Best of luck with the internship and the babu."
622ddy,35,"Internships are usually flexible with their scheduling when it comes to stuff like this.  If you've already accepted the offer, just send the recruiter an email saying ""I wanted to give you a heads up that I'm 12w pregnant, so during the internship I might need to take a day off once in a while for prenatal doctor's visits.""

I had to skip the last week of my internship to attend a cyber security camp, and they were fully supportive (even got a full-time offer from them, but ended up going somewhere else)."
622ddy,35,"I don't think you have to tell your recruiter or most of your coworkers if you don't wish to. It might be worth mentioning to your boss in private a few weeks into working (assuming they seem nice enough) just so they are aware of what's going on in your life and why you might need time off.

I was dealing with some mental heath issues when I interned at a company. I mentioned I had been missing some work due to ""health issues"" in a vague way and my boss was very understanding. You might not even have to say that you are pregnant. "
622ddy,35,"Congrats on the pregnancy!!! I pretty much agree with what everyone else has been saying about not telling your recruiter and not worrying. Also, internships are less demanding than full-time, and I've heard of some interns working less than 40 hrs/week and still getting all their work done, so I don't think your pregnancy will be much of a hindrance to you getting your work done. You're growing a human and interning at the same time! Don't be too hard on yourself, I'm sure everything will be fine :)"
622ddy,35,"> I haven't determined housing yet but if I get a roommate I was planning on informing them of my pregnancy but my question is whether I have a moral obligation to also tell my recruiter.

Don't do it. Pregnancy is a protected class. Would you tell them the color of your skin?"
622ddy,35,"It's illegal to [discriminate based on pregnancy](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm) in the United States. Since Washington tends to be further left than the White House, it probably goes further. So, you should be fine. Congrats all the same!"
622ddy,35,"Tell them, they can't really do anything about it since it will be super - ultra - big discrimination.

Also you will have a clean conscious.

Also, for the record, you *will* be less productive than you normally are, so don't push yourself too much."
622ddy,35,"It's an internship - you will be fine! 

I have a 1 year old son and worked up until I was 37 weeks pregnant with him then burnt my annual leave. The good news is that assuming you stay low risk the only adjustment you might need is some extra back support in your chair - I never found working a serious hardship even at 30+ weeks along.  "
622ddy,35,"Like others have said, feel no obligation to tell them beforehand and just show up. But I'd like to offer a different viewpoint:

An internship is more than just an opportunity to gain work experience. While your employer is evaluating you, you should be evaluating them!  Any place that does not treat you as an equal due to your gender is not a place you want a full time job at. 

As for telling people at work: treat it just like you would with potential friends. My coworkers share when they are engaged, expecting babies, going on vacations, etc. Workplaces are much more enjoyable when you build connections and friendships with your coworkers. Don't feel you need to hide your pregnancy. If you're excited about it and want to share / discuss, go ahead.

Personal Side Note:
The whole idea of having to fit a pregnancy into your lunch hours is garbage. I realize this is more an issue with living and working in America. But I would strongly encourage you to hunt down organizations that are offering fair paternity and maternity  leave packages. The only way to really drive change is to reward companies (with your employment) that have HR policies in line with the majority of first world nations rather than the current backwards archaic policies that are often the norm in USA. "
622ddy,35,"First of all, congratulations!

In my personal opinion: absolutely don't tell them. Why? Because even though you may (or not, depending on all sorts of factors, from how your employment is categorized to the size of your company) be entitled to certain legal protections due to your pregnancy and also due to any issues you may have, proving discrimination is insanely hard. So, just don't even give them a chance to try and discriminate in advance. There's a great chance that they might be shitty about it, and there's also a great chance that there's no logical reason for them to do so. I worked until the last weekday before my baby was born with zero problem, and same goes for many women who have non-physical jobs. "
622ddy,35,"I'm a software developer, at 36 weeks now. I don't have any useful advice really, since I'm working in Europe. But I did want to express  solidarity; you're not the only one. 

Each pregnancy varies, so a lot of it just depends on how your body does. I haven't had many issues, but my job is also fairly chill, at 40 hours a week. On the other hand, my colleague had to stop a few months early and go on bed rest. 

If I were you, I'd wait until a little closer to your internship, and give the recruiter a heads up that you're pregnant. It's a little bit out of respect for the company (or at least, to make you look responsible), and a little bit CYA. Ironically, while you're pregnant, they'll have a harder time justifying firing you, since it's such an easy discrimination suit. 

On a non-professional note, I would leave time to take care of yourself. I've cut down on networking events and stopped taking extra classes. If you've got the money, you should absolutely take it easy - hire a cleaner, buy pre-made foods, let yourself lounge on the couch all Saturday.

Best of luck, and I hope you have a happy, healthy baby. "

5q1wuj,14,"It can't hurt to ask.  They are big company and they hire college kids to start 8 to 12 months in advance.  So I can't see it being an issue.

If you don't want to tell them about your pregnancy then just say it's for personal reasons."
5q1wuj,14,"If you don't tell them you're pregnant, they won't be able to find out. You'd get the job (assuming you pass all the interviews) and then you work for some months and go on maternity leave. 

Are you only a month or two pregnant? Most women tend to work for 8 months (or in some cases, the entire duration) of their pregnancy and then go on maternity leave, at least that's how it's in the US.  "
5q1wuj,14,"If you get an offer, I would tell your future potential managers about the pregnancy.

It would be an asshole thing to do to make a manager burn head count for someone that will be taking a leave right after joining his team."
715zo8,5,"I took 3 months between my first and second job, and I remember feeling *very* rusty coming back full time. I had done little projects in my free time, but the thing I remember the most is the mental strain of transitioning back to full time. It felt like I tried to run a 10 mile race without training, except with my brain. 

As far as easing back into it, I'd do whatever sounds like fun to work on. If you can't think of anything, you could look for an open source project to contribute to using [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/), or take on little programming puzzles with apps like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). "
715zo8,5,"So funnily enough I took off last September until feb as well. I thought I'd do no coding, surprise surprise I got bored and started up again mid January. I was travelling sept through November and moving cross country (driving) December so I didn't even have access to a laptop a lot. I did fine. Yeah I was a bit shaky getting back up but the theory comes back to you and the syntax is just syntax. You have a great job offer and will presumably be junior so, I say just focus on your pregnancy and classes-you already have this, you'll put in the time and energy when the start date comes. They saw your potential. Trust them. Pregnancy is a big deal and you need to take care of yourself first. "
715zo8,5,"Congrats on the baby, they are awesome.  I mean, as long as you understand the basics and you are going to be in a Junior dev role you'll be fine. You should be able to pick back up fairly quickly. Unless you absolutely don't want to code during the break then that's your choice. But a few hours a week would probably go a long way. "
715zo8,5,"I took about a month of of coding before. I felt ""rusty"" coming back into it, but it all came back very fast. I would not worry about it. If you really feel the need to, you don't have to do a big project or anything, you could just try to do one leetcode/hackerrank/etc. question every day in Java (or whatever language)."

3ogr1p,14,"I work in a small tech group that has a high proportion of women. Three of them have been pregnant and taken maternity leave in the last 3-4 years. I don't know when they revealed they were pregnant -- some of them might have waited until pretty late. They continued working until close to birth and then took about 3 months off. 
"
3ogr1p,14,"I think it's just like anything other time you plan to take a lot of time off. Wait until your plans are 'for sure', and work with your boss to best handle it. Plan with project scope in mind or whatever it takes so that you don't take on a bunch of tasks and leave everyone high and dry. 

Be realistic about everything. Your body needs time to heal and your baby needs extra care and attention. Some people may insist you need little time because they know someone who popped a kid out and was doing yoga later in the day (women do this as much, if not more than men in my experience btw, so don't think that it only exists with male bosses). If they are mistaken, be firm in assuring them of your medical needs. 

And at the same time, be realistic about returning. Some people let their mentality at work be only about the baby for way too long (ie, every day for months claiming they need to leave early to ""help the wife/husband with the baby"") when really they just have grown accustomed to have a scapegoat. Not at all saying you'd do this, but I've had several professional friends who let their careers take a big hit because they acted like that and no one around them wanted to be an evil baby hater. 

And of course - make sure to keep it all positive. This is your family, and this is what life's all about. "
3ogr1p,14,"Not a woman, but I've had women coworkers in medical device companies where you needed to tell HR immediately: When working with X-Rays/CT and even MRIs they have a pretty hefty CYA policy in place due to potential complications and differences in exposure limits.

As far as guys taking leave: it varies greatly on a company-to-company basis in the USA.  When my first son was born I took close to 5 weeks combined between vacation and Parental Leave.  The Parental Leave was new at the company at the time. I can't say for certain, but my taking it may have contributed to my inclusion in a following layoff.

For my second I've taken about 2 weeks so far- one week vacation, one week unpaid leave. I'm still in my first year at the company so FMLA doesn't apply and I don't have much vacation accrued."
3ogr1p,14,"Not me. My coworker is an awesome mom and extremely well planned.  She worked full time until her first, took maternity leave, then switched to part time upon returning.  On the days she works her kids stay with grandparents or go to daycare. This way she keeps coding, can ""stay sane"", and be involved with raising her kids.

A lot has to do with employer selection and she made sure she found an arrangement that worked for her family.

She announced to the whole team after the doctors had confirmed ""perfectly healthy baby -gender-"""
3ogr1p,14,"I wanted to take my whole 3 weeks of vacation after my oldest daughter (now 3) was born to spend time with her and my wife.

I mentioned this to my manager who has two girls of his own (teenagers).

The conversation went something like this:
""I see you put in for all 3 weeks.  You can take them if you want but TRUST ME only take a week, you'll be ready to come back after that I assure you.""

I took his advice..he was right. :)

my wife is on her feet at work and she was working right up until the end of both pregnancies.  "
5nhhtp,8,Although I dislike open plan offices as much as the next guy I think pretending they give you PTSD is dishonest and laughable. So no.

5nhhtp,8,[deleted]
5nhhtp,8,"This is soooo stupid and so easily countered I would think.

At best, if you have some employee related protections (is that a thing in the US?), you might get special designated rooms for people who can't take a full open office. 

You would have so many people countering you about why its good and why they do it and that they arn't affected by it I would think. Would be extremely hard to prove. It would come down to your personal mental state which has nothing to do with an open office, although the OO might not help it.

Just my thoughts. I also think Silicon Valley and other locations would be highly spiteful against anyone who participated. "
5nhhtp,8,"Are... Are you fucking serious? 

Really? Don't work somewhere with an open office if it bothers you. There. Solved. 

I don't understand how people get so upset about an open office. I've been in an open office and a cube farm. I liked them both. Just gets some good headphones and do your work?

4y0xr2,6,"Some companies that recruit on campus will give in person interviews if you are a strong candidate. Some even fly intern candidates out for onsite interviews, such as Microsoft and Palantir. But for the most part, a majority of companies just interview over the phone or Skype for internships."
4y0xr2,6,"My 4 internship interviews have been at most three rounds consisting of:

 * The ""check if you can interact with humans"" phone interview with a recruiter
 * The technical phone interview with an engineer giving you a problem on hackerrank
 * The final in-person interview on a whiteboard or on a laptop (more often it's the laptop)"
4a6gdq,6,"Work your normal hours, and maybe just a tiny bit more as a courtesy.

If asked or required to put in overtime, explain that you'd rather not do two jobs for the price of one, and ask for an appropriate promotion or at least raise.

This also protects your manager from being laid off while on maternity leave due to the appearance that she's unnecessary."
4a6gdq,6,"
>If I leave now, I'll burn a bridge and put the team in a really tight spot. 

It's the companies job to do capacity planning, not yours. If you guys are already working long hours, you are understaffed.

They can't understaff a department and then expect people to not make career changes to protect them. People leave, that's a fact of live. A company must plan for that. If they don't, that's their fault and their problem. 

Don't be guilted to stay just because they suck at planning. "
4a6gdq,6,"Are you getting paid enough to work these hours? If no, ask for a raise to take over these responsibilities "
4a6gdq,6,"If you're overworked, leaving is exactly what you should do and exactly what they should expect."
4a6gdq,6,see if you can get an engineer on loan from another part of the company.  this will drastically reduce any onboarding and will often work out so that they take on the brunt of operational or mundane work.
4a6gdq,6,"Your manager's engineering tasks should be distributed amongst your team, but her purely managerial stuff should be picked up by another manager, maybe the individual she reports to. Someone on the team may have to step up to be the ""lead"" in terms of making implementation decisions or redistribute some tasks, but you need a **manager** assigned to your team to do manager-y stuff.

If the company doesn't have proper coverage for this event, it's their screwup and any schedule slips or people leaving due to workload is the company's fault. It's not like they *didn't* know this was coming.

You're already being overworked and no one here would fault you for leaving even if your manager wasn't taking maternity leave. In your mind, you've already got one foot out the door if you've been looking around. Keep going. You'd be surprised how many of your teammates say ""take me with you"" rather than ""you jerk"" when you do leave."

e8zxbp,51,"If what you’re saying is accurate I wouldn’t sweat this guy and start looking for another job, you’re doing fine.

If you want to fix things where you are you need to make it known that you are unable to execute on poor communication. Honestly I would talk to his supervisor and let them know he is insulting you when it’s his communication that is to blame."

I can relate to the lack of onboarding, I've been with my current employer for about 6 months now and I still don't know who's in charge of assigning and closing out tickets. I literally have to ""ask around"" when I'm looking for a new task."
e8zxbp,51,"You jumped into something non-trivial. You may genuinely be in over your head. The good news, if it exists, is that your employer seems to be doing real work - work that’s harder than. 80-90% of the industry. That means both that it’ll be harder to hide / fake it til you make it, and that your next job is gonna feel like a breeze."
e8zxbp,51,"Your actual job sounds exciting. I.e. the fact that you were given nontrivial work is a good sign.

Unfortunately, your boss sounds like a real a-hole. If it weren't for the fact that that the work sounds interesting, I would say get out of there. 

Is there any way you could get moved to a different team with perhaps better leadership and similar work?"
e8zxbp,51,"Now that you have a real job on your resume, it will be a lot easier to find a new one. 

I would begin interviewing for new roles ASAP.

Don't stay at this company unless your can transfer internally to a new group.

Unfortunately many skilled engineers have superiority complexes and no social skills.

Don't drown in his shit any longer than you need to. Life is short."

e8zxbp,51,"Ironically, if he thinks this leadership style is acceptable, he is mentally deficient. Its not you, its him. If you're really well liked in the company, you might be able to go to his boss to ask for a transfer (especially if you have another manager willing to take you). This is a risky play and unless you have a lot of support could go badly. Assuming you can't, get out.

When you're in interviews, phrase it as an issue the whole team sees and make sure you express the problem, but phrase it in business  terms as well as human ones. Ie ""several members on our x person team have left in the last year. Our productivity has been significantly lower than other teams because..."". Make it sound like you're frustrated and think things could be much better, but it isn't a huge emotional deal for you."

I left that field because it's filled with a majority of HS Grads and dropouts (no that this is a bad thing) that tend to feel challenged by anyone and anything new. Turns out my manager at the time was an industry-known moron who bullshitted his way through his whole career. We found out about a year later when we got the hang of things. 

Start recording or taking notes of conversations you have with him, try to get some kind of proof or evidence that he's being abusive - his language alone is abusive. Start looking for a new job too, you don't owe them anything and have a lot grid to just get through the last 6 months without any guidance. You can use the evidence if anything messed up happens before you find a job, like he decides to fire you over something stupid.

I fully get the dick manager part, just check my post history if you need proof of that.

You still would have a full month to play with react fulltime before classes start."

Then once you start doing react, make some notes about the differences between the two and the advantages/disadvantages between the two. Being able to talk insightfully about the tradeoffs between different tools is very useful.

I am doing a 2nd degree and had to take almost ZERO gen-ed's again. A degree is a degree, and although my BA in PolySci is nothing like my BS Software Dev program, I only had to take two adtl math classes - the rest were waived. Maybe switch to a different school, or ask about having electives/gen-ed's waived. I did, and I'm a 160c/h sophomore ha. 

Next, this Master's route. If you go after the MS, you'll most likely have to take ""bridge courses"" or something. Which maaay not be for credit, eligible for financial aid, and put you back another semester or two. 

Honestly, stick out the school now. I know it sucks - trust me. I'm literally doing it too, along with working full-time.

Apply for jobs. Either take some more undergrad CS classes (mainly Data Structures and Algorithms), or study on your own. Then start applying.

You may possibly rule out bigger tech companies as a first job in doing so, but my boss's boss at a big N company had a BS in Finance.

I had an architect at a previous job who had a BS in Econ. A senior dev who was Theater. I myself majored in Psychology.

1q2dn9,11,"I would say don't mention it or say you had a leadership position in a ""campus club"" (even ""human rights activism"" sounds political) only if asked about leadership; many will take the hint that perhaps it was religious or political and not ask (because it could be stepping near where employers May Not Tread), but some will go ahead and ask so if you do bring it up at all realize the entirety may come out and there is a possibility it could hurt your chances.

Besides the fact that the topic itself might be polarizing, bringing it up at all might make them concerned about mixing activism and work or that it could later somehow bite them (maybe they have a customer or supplier on one side of the issue and would be worried about your ability to work with them, or think it would offend co-workers, whatever); employers value ""safe"" there."
1q2dn9,11,"Definitely no! That is something you need to hide. Think anonymous, and why people hide their identities at rallies. You are going to be surprised at how negatively people look at students who engage in social activism, particularly by people in the corporate world who are in charge of hiring."
1q2dn9,11,"No, because it shows that you lack the common sense not to bring politics into the workplace. I don't care if I agree with a job candidate on every political issue, I honestly don't want to know that because it opens me up to lawsuits on the basis of discrimination about political beliefs. If someone came into my office for an interview and told me about their pro-choice activism I'd be equally inclined not to hire them for the same lack of common sense. A big part of getting along with others in the work place is knowing when to keep your mouth shut. 

Also I don't want to know what you're doing outside of work politics wise because your views don't necessarily represent the company. If you come into an interview trying to talk about those views, that may give the company the impression that you intend to go out and say things that might embarrass the company. 

The reason we don't bring politics into the workplace is some political positions can be seen as antagonistic towards your coworkers and make them uncomfortable. In addition teams that spend time arguing and hating each other over things that don't matter a lick to their work are less productive. When you go to work, you're not there to advance your agenda, you're there to work. Any kind of discussion that would make a coworker uncomfortable or possibly cause a fight is off limits. "

1q2dn9,11,"1. Are you out of your mind? You think that, in a workplace, it would be at all acceptable to be openly antagonistic to your coworkers, *many of whom will be women.* If you want a job in the field, you need to learn, quickly, to tone that shit down to the point that nobody would ever know that you were political in the slightest, let alone on a women's issue. Seriously, this isn't even a question.

2. Understand that your employer may find out, anyway, if there is anything whatsoever online with your name on it, or reported with your name on it. This will be a really fast way to blackball you from a LOT of software companies as being an office troublemaker who, regardless of his quality of work, get the company involved in a lawsuit somehow. If you have an alternate name to go by, I suggest you use it on your resume. The rule for work is that if you don't want it showing up on a Google search of your name, don't do it. This is one of those things."
1q2dn9,11,"No, probably not. You might make an exception if you are absolutely certain that all of the people you're speaking with are of a similar mindset, but stay away from controversial topics like abortion. If possible, I try to do some research on members of the team I'm interviewing for, to use to my advantage. As an example, I learned that one of my potential interviewers was very interested in renewable energy, so when I spoke with him, I brought up issues relating that *and* the job at hand. Obviously this isn't always possible, but a company like Twitter *might* be a place where you can work in a watered down version of your case (e.g., to show your passion for providing the medium/service). I would say developers are overwhelmingly liberal by U.S. standards, so your chances of ruffling feathers is probably low."
1q2dn9,11,"Absolutely not, it's a horrible idea.

It's a controversial issue and people WILL judge you for it.

You need to be able to work with these people and they need to be able to work with you.

Why employ you when you are so willing to share your political views?

That just sounds like a liability waiting to happen, especially when there are hundreds of other graduates JUST LIKE YOU that perhaps don't have views like that, or maybe do but simply know that it's not appropriate to bring politics into the work place."
3qpwbb,5,"Basically was in a similar position as you a few years ago, couldnt find work with my first degree out of college. My gpa was low(never went to class and rarely did homework), I hadnt done an intership, and it was right after the economy tanked.  Ended up working a bunch of menial jobs and feeling like I had wasted the 5 years I spent in college.

So I decided I wanted to get into something else and started looking at doing something with computers, as I had always been a computer nerd but never looked at it as a possible profession.  Decided after struggling to find work with no experience to go back for a second degree, figured while I was doing classes I would have better opportunities to find part time work with computers, I was right, though not right away. 

When I went back I treated it alot like it was a honest to goodness job, never skipped a single class, did all the homework.  Possibly most important I made a conscious effort to be in regular contact with my professors.  This ended up leading to me getting all As in my early CS class and getting a job working as student worker for the dept.  I made it clear early on that I would do any kind of work for professors, any grading, being a lab assistant, tutoring, etc.  Which was good because it got me in good with most of the faculty and ended up landing me a job working on a side project for the department chair working on a database and the associated website.  For the rest of the time I was in school I got to work on this project and learn a ton and gain a bunch of experience that basically made me a shoe in for my first REAL job after school, working as a Web Dev for that same school.  

Basically I would suggest doing what I did treat it as a job(this is alot easier coming from working in the real world than post high school).  Realize that if you put forth the effort there are a ton of opportunities to gain the kind of experience that will improve your job prospects post-graduation.  Professors almost always have some research/side projects that they need students to be code monkeys for."
3qpwbb,5,"Get a bunch of internships. It's a fun way to sample a bunch of different companies and roles, and get paid. By the time you graduate you'd look like a rockstar from a glance at your resume. It sucks if you apply for a really cool company and get turned down, but you just gota keep cranking out applications until you get interviews. And you just gota keep interviewing until something sticks. The more project you work on the more likely you get interviews, and in those interviews you'll have something to show and talk about. Which brings me to my next point...

Work on projects that you can put on Github. Big or small. You'll REALLY look like a rockstar when you put your github on your resume and people can see stuff you've worked on. Sounds daunting but really you can start something small like a twitter bot. Once you get into the habit or putting anything and everything big or small on Github, you'll really look good. I mean don't post your silly trivial hw projects but stuff you put up doesn't always have to be some large app. 

Keep your grades up. Grade highly correlates with the number of invites you receive to interviews. I mean you don't have to be a 4.0 student but <3.2 you start to look mediocre and ~3.0 you're really flying too close to ground. Many internships at big companies require a 3.2GPA min and in some cases 3.4. At some companies GPA is the first filter. Your application may not even meet a human eye if you don't hit a certain GPA threshold. 

Hackatons are cool but don't stress about being in one. I still would recommend tho because you get a lot of idea of what people can create, what technology people are using, also you get to borrow a lot of ideas for your own projects. If anything use it as a networking event as a lot of companies usually come out.

Talk to your classmates or join a CS related club. Hang around people that are engineers and developers. See what people are working on. A lot of your learning comes from osmosis. Sometimes you don't even a topic or even be in a conversation. You'd be surprised at how much you learn by accidentally eavesdropping on something interesting and relevant. But for that to happen you have to be around people."
3qpwbb,5,"Get as many internships as possible and try to get as much responsibility and experience from them as possible. If you want a shot at the Big 4 and similar companies, then study data structures, algos, and competitive programming/interview problems as soon as you know your first language. "

e4ntxj,4,"Never really noticed any issues from where I stand; one transman I'm aware of is in our office and he's well integrated into his team, has lunch with his coworkers regularly, etc. Your ask is somewhat broad so I'm not sure if this gives you what you're after"
e4ntxj,4,"Met 1 or 2. Have never noticed any problems that have come from it, but granted, I'm not them, so I can't really speak for their experience."
e4ntxj,4,"I had a MtF coworker transition and pretty much everyone was fine with it.  There were a couple of people who would still slip up with the pronouns and I know that got under her skin a bit.  This was in the banking sector in the Midwest so there was a high level of professionalism expected from employees so I would have been really surprised if anyone did anything openly outrageous or nasty.  I didn't really hear anything bad through the rumor mill either.  We didn't work together too close so there could have been things going on in the background that I didn't know about.

If I remember right she was promoted to a manager sometime after I left so it seemed to be going well for her."
e4ntxj,4,"I dont know the answer to this.  I am a currently stealth trans man.  Even in progressive workplaces and cities I have experienced discrimination and derogatory comments.  I have been lucky that the workplace issues I've had have been pretty mild.  If you're looking for employment, you could always ask about LGBT acceptance, trans healthcare coverage, etc and feel out their response.  

It's hard out there, but tech in the bay area is probably one of the best places for a trans person to be in the U.S."
8qzxi5,76,"Unfortunately you can never know. It is about what you can prove. It's simply very plausible that they simply found someone that's better. To answer one specific question: 

>  I mean, if they did find a better candidate, good for them, but do you really need to tell me why he is so much better than me. I mean in my mind that is just really unprofessional and suspicious.

It really isn't, sorry. It happens. Telling someone they didn't make the cut is always hard.

I'm not saying they didn't drop you because you're transgender, maybe they did. But it will be impossible to find out, let alone take legal action on. In my opinion it's best not to dwell on it and move on. Also:

> I'll admit the office was rather small at only 25 people, but I would at least think I would see at least one woman or person of color there. Nope. Of the 15 or so people I saw in the main area, there wasn't a single woman or person of color.

That really isn't saying anything. I'm Dutch and all my direct colleagues are white males. We'd love to hire women / black people / transgender people /gay / whatever. As you know we're quite a bit more liberal here in Holland than in the US. But there's simply very very few people with that back-ground who apply. If you are going to call a company 'racist' or whatever because they currently only employ white males you are in fact judging a book by it's cover. And I think we all decided that's a bad idea right?

Edit: I checked the responses in the other topic. I really want to warn you against getting too carried away with this. Especially the most up-voted comment is just jumping to conclusions WAY too fast. IMHO [this is the best reply you got there](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8na9zt/my_job_offer_was_rescinded_after_i_mentioned_i/dzus3gp/).

It's incredibly easy for random people to just shout ""sue them"". Just like in this sub a lot of people immediately tell you to get a new job if there's something wrong at the current one. That's easy. They're not the one who have to deal with the fallout of these decisions. No matter what; accusing someone of discrimination will ruin your image with that person forever, *especially* if they were not discriminating. "
8qzxi5,76,"I have a very impressive resume and got rejected in a very, very short period of time.  What's strange is that I got about a 40&#37; return rate on the jobs that I applied for.  I think it was age related and they were the only one to ask when I graduated from college.

The issue is proving it.  Any real company will know when to shut up.  I was told by one person that seemed to really know his stuff, that the government will take care of the investigation.

The real problem is did they actually base the decision on that or something else?  There's no way they'll ever admit to anything, but you do have an offer.

I just noticed:

>TLDR: Got a call from a company saying they were going to extend an offer pending reference and background check. Told them I used to go by a previous name while sending over references, couple days later the offer was rescinded.

Reading that, you say they were going to extend an offer.  Did they actually extend an offer and how did they inform you that you were going to get an offer?

It seems kinda odd that they would say ""we're going to make an offer, we're not making an offer, but we will be making an offer...""  Seems they would just wait until they made a decision in stead of saying we've ALMOST made a decision."
8qzxi5,76,"My only advice would be to be very careful who you listen to regarding this issue. The other topic seems to suggest taking legal action, whereas I'd recommend just doing your best to move on and avoid the frustration and fees of the legal process. This is especially true given that you can't actually prove anything, unfortunately."
8qzxi5,76,Probably not. This stuff happens all the time. 
8qzxi5,76,"This is a a little bit off topic, but I feel it needed to be said.

Diversity of skin color is absolutely meaningless, your skin color doesn't affect how you think or your skillsets. The only diversity that matters is the diversity of thought. You could have a room full of people of all colors and sizes, but if they all thought the same way ideas wouldn't be challenged and it would create a piss poor enviornment for innovation."
8qzxi5,76,"You should really contact your references and make sure they refer to you by your new name. It sucks that people discriminate, but they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do and your most practical option is to just preemptively defend against a situation like this. 

Now of course, if you want to stand up for your principles etc., by all means go ahead and that may be the right thing to do for you. I’m just offering advice from an objectively success-oriented point of view"
8qzxi5,76,Hi there. Shit happens. go stealth (src: stealthed)
8qzxi5,76,"I would say it sounds like discrimination, yes.  I don't think you have any good evidence of it, though, so I wouldn't expect you'd have much luck pursing legal action.  There are two plausible explanations that aren't discrimination:

* They did get a last minute candidate that blew them away.  That seems unlikely to me because they would've waited to tell you they wanted to hire you until after they interviewed him, but it's at least plausible.

* Your references were disappointing in some way other than your name issue.  Perhaps someone they talked to them said something that raised a red flag.

As I'm not a lawyer, I'm legitimately asking this, but is discrimination against transgender people illegal in your state or any state?  I know it's still legal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation nationally and in most states.  I'm not aware of what the laws are on this issue.  Do you know if there's even an anti-discrimination law that would protect you even if you could prove discrimination?

Anyway, as you pointed out, I think you need to talk to r/legaladvice or consider getting a consultation with an attorney.  Ultimately, though, from a lay person's perspective, I don't see anything actionable here.

You were probably discriminated against, and I'm sorry that happened to you.  It isn't okay as far as I'm concerned for whatever that's worth.  I'm of the opinion, however, that you should name and shame this company at least."
8qzxi5,76,"It sounds sketchy, plain and simple. I don’t know if you have enough to form a legal case, since they covered their tracks with the “we just found someone else!” Thing. 

Also, I don’t know about the opinions of this sub in general re:discrimination. I’ve watched it for a while and they have a very knee-jerk “discrimination isn’t real in cs” reaction to every post about “is this discrimination?” I see. It’s an observable trend. I’ve observed it."
8qzxi5,76,[deleted]
8qzxi5,76,"Yes it could have been discrimination since the timing is so strange. It would be hard to prove short of someone in that company speaking up I think. 
Was this through an agency? If it was a large one they have legal counsel for these things, like I would have a number my candidate can call. 

If not then I guess the question in the end is if you have the money and energy to fight it. The idealist in me wants to say, ""do it! Show them!"" but I am realistic enough to realize what a long and expensive ordeal it would be. 
So so sorry this happened to you. "
8qzxi5,76,"It's hard to say whether it's discrimination or not. It definitely seems odd the timing and how they were informing you about the new decision (which at the very least as you mention is pretty unprofessional). Though ironically it could turn out to all be true, and the strange discussion detailing why they made that decision might've been out of fear of it being interpreted as discrimination if they didn't make it clear they had this legitimate reason. 

Now if it was actually discrimination then you could take legal action against them. Or to a lesser extent if you have any kind governmental workers representation body you could take it up with. 

The hardest part however (going by what you've told us so far) will be proving it is discrimination. Since no one made any kind of remark or treated you in a way that could clearly show discrimination, it's very easy for the company to defend against the current claim. If you could find out they've had a history of doing this then you would have a stronger case, but that could be hard to find depending on who it is. Unfortunately this is one of the realities many people who face discrimination experience, and there's no clear way to tackle this either (compared to the more obvious cases of discrimination). 

If you do have a strong feeling you were discriminated against (you'd know better than anyone reading the story) I'd recommend consulting legal counsel or seeking out some government body and see what they suggest. "
8qzxi5,76,"A law is only as good as its enforcement.

You may be able to demonstrate a correlation, but the burden is on you to prove causation if you take them to court. These companies have a lot more money and lawyers than you do, so you better have a smoking gun to throw at them. "
8qzxi5,76,"unfortunately not. If you were really rescinded (as in, you were given an explicit offer you agreed to, then the offer was revoked after background check) with no other significant negatives in your history (drugs, bad blood, etc), you may indeed have enough of a case to assume discrimination  and seek a lawyer for further advice. Without that offer, it's all in a black hole. maybe you were discriminated against, maybe candidate B was better, maybe you had a reference with an axe to grind, etc. 

OFC IANAL, so if you feel strongly about this, definitely consult one about the matter. But those are my 2 cents. I really am sorry, I've been rescinded before (had an offer, but didn't sign on yet) and it really sucks. I can only imagine how much worse it is for you with you since there is a chance this was done for less than legal reasons. Otherwise, best of luck with the better offer!"
8qzxi5,76,"> but do you really need to tell me why he is so much better than me.

Yes, as a defense against you claiming he wasn't a better candidate when you sue them.

This is why I wouldn't mention any religion, political views, gender changes, etc. during the hiring process.  If you only have references for 1 previous job, then only give them those, especially if your other jobs weren't even software.  If you had 2 jobs under the one name, I might have even left off the third job.

> Anyways, does this sound like discrimination?

You might want to talk to a lawyer.  It sounds like it was and you can might be able to get them to settle out of court for some money.  Or maybe you have better things to do with your time."
8qzxi5,76,"Nobody here can tell you what went on in the mind of your employer.  If you really think this is discrimination, then you speak to an attorney about moving forward legally.  Professionally, you move forward and find an employer that will respect you.  The silver lining is that you don't want to work for a company the refuses to hire transgender people.  Consider it a bullet dodged and move forward."
8qzxi5,76,"\> I mean in my mind that is just really unprofessional and suspicious. It just seemed like she was trying to cover the company's ass by overselling it.

Of course she is trying to cover the company by telling you that.

\>Anyways, does this sound like discrimination? Or is this pretty standard in the software world? Have any of you guys experienced anything like this?

Yup it is. Happens to everyone at some point. Could be because you looked funny to them, you made some stupid comment that put them off to you, or you could just have a personality that they don't want. There's no point in fighting this legally since companies will usually cover their butts from this angle. Legally speaking, your feelings don't matter. What matters is what you are able to prove based on hard evidence. It sounds like they never mentioned anything to you that could directly prove discrimination, it just \*\*feels\*\* like it to you.

My advice is to let this go and continue your job search."

Because of the way this question is framed and because I'm not trans, I don't really know how to approach answering this question. As /u/ImmunteFourier says ""What units would you like the measurement in?""

So, I'll answer a related question that is easier for me:

To which I think I'd say: Yes. though you should check with a trans software engineer I suppose.

Putting extra skill points into clear technical communication is often a wise choice for folks coming out of uni. I've generally recommended that people help their classmates out with problem sets or TA classes because clearly explaining some proof-by-induction on a whiteboard is very similar to clearly explaining the answer to some whiteboard question in an interview or explaining some design trade-offs in day-to-day work.

If you like books, I recommend: [Style: Towards Clarity and Grace](https://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2014/07/WilliamsJosephM1990StyleTowardClarityandGrace.pdf), [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hjranTvDU), and more speculatively...

I work at a BigN or whatever they're calling these companies these days. The person I work with was able to take several months off, maybe to get surgery, I don't know, it's not appropriate to ask.

Wouldn't this behaviour be contradictory to the idea that the company has ""has strong lgbt protections""?

aoz7jr,13,"You don't have an offer yet. IMO, keep looking for summer internships where you can be yourself and continue transitioning in peace. Worry about this particular internship when and if you actually have an offer in hand and don't have a better competing one.

For this aspect, there's definitely no need to out yourself to HR if you're not comfortable with doing so. If you're not a minor, you have no obligation to live with a guardian.

Dysphoria is part of the DSM 5. IANAL, but I believe this means you fall under a protected class & may be able to request reasonable accommodations at work. I am not sure whether avoiding a specific person could fall under that umbrella, but it's worth investigating. See also: [https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/transgender-people-and-law](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/transgender-people-and-law)

When you're getting ready to sign an offer && if you're still considering the company where Person A works, I strongly recommend asking r/legaladvice what you'll need to do to avoid seeing them at work and whether that would even fall under 'reasonable accommodations'. To the best of my understanding, this is not an issue you should need to discuss with your hiring manager directly. It's something you would discuss with HR, and they would do the work of tactfully informing your manager should your manager need to be in the loop.

But try not to worry about this until you have the offer. Until you have something in hand, there's no guarantee. Don't borrow trouble? :)"
aoz7jr,13,I’d be honest about it.  If it’s going to be a problem then you probably want to know now as opposed to in 3 months.  That would suck.
aoz7jr,13,If you had other offers you already declined you should definitely contact them and see if they still have spots available. If nothing else it will give you the option to avoid dealing with this complicated situation entirely since you and person A wouldn't be working at the same company. If your other internship offers were also in a different that would also solve your housing issues.  
aoz7jr,13,"Just to get this right- person A is your parent? If you don't get a stipend and this is a paid internship just rent a room. Many summer interns do it, and you can sublease and get a good deal.

Take my advice with grain of salt, but I wouldn't disclose this to your manager, the same way people don't usually disclose other personal issues. It's not a big deal unless you make it a big deal. Good luck"

37dhxp,3,"One thing you could do is what a lot of the foreign people who take American names do and put your birth name in parentheses in between your preferred name and last name. 

But I wouldn't do that.  I would just use your preferred name and not mention your birth name (and definitely don't mention that you're  transgender).  If you get to the references and background check stage you will have a chance to tell them your birth name"
7a6klr,5," > micromanagement or use micromanagement tools like JIRA and agile concepts.

I don't know what your new boss was doing, but they must have been doing it wrong.   Agile done right is pretty awesome as it tries to objectively set expectations via velocity numbers and you have a clear path of what needs to be done.  "
7a6klr,5,">
I need to know the best tactics I can use to avoid working at a place that prescribes micromanagement. I've already decided I don't want to ever again work for a company that uses JIRA in any capacity. I'm not going to work for any place where words like ""sprint"" and ""burndown"" are part of the vocabulary. How do I articulate this while looking for a job?

Oof.  These are pretty ubiquitous in the software world these days.  And I promise not every company is dead set on metrics even if they use JIRA and use words like sprint or burndown.

In the case you've already made up your mind, the question you want to ask during interviews is ""Do you use agile""?  Agile is the one you don't like.  Waterfall is the one that you'll want.

Unfortunately for you, a vast majority of software companies use agile.  Waterfall is typically used by large companies that make releases infrequently or ship-it-and-forget-it sort of software.


> Are there companies who will hire on phone Skype interviews alone? Or will I have to use up all my vacation time to take a road trip across the country for a single interview?

Erm look for remote jobs?  For those Skype interviews will likely suffice.  You can move out of Texas on your own sweet time.  But generally most interviews require face to face and you'd be severely limiting your career and salary by restricting yourself to a smaller pool of companies willing to do remote.

Good luck dude(ette?)."

Good luck there. Those requirements are completely nonsensical. "
35bgeo,18,"It will make it harder in any field, software development is no exception."
35bgeo,18,"As long as you outwardly present as one or the other of the traditional (binary) genders and don't make a big deal of it unless anyone asks, I expect you'll be fine. 

You might have a hard time if you typically dress as what a good friend of mine, who is trans, would type as ""mixed"", e.g., wearing heels and pearls with a traditional men's suit, or wearing a dress with face stubble. Most of the country just doesn't have the experience being around people like you and like my friend to really be able to, well, grok it and go about their daily lives. 

Zhe sometimes has a really hard time with more traditional people, but generally presents as male (and looks very neutral without any makeup) and so has an easier time in work environments and so on.

Mainly, as long as it isn't brought up, it should be a non-issue. Gender (and sexuality) are really more part of your personal life than your work life, I think."
35bgeo,18,"It probably depends more on the company. As a whole I'd say the software engineering industry is generally more progressive in this regard. But it'll probably make more of a difference (if at all) at a conservative long-standing non-technical business that employs software engineers compared to newer tech companies or start ups.

Personally I've only had experience working at the same place (not the same team) as transgendered people and non-heterosexual sexualities (that I know of). It didn't seem to be a big deal. There was a homosexual guy on a closely related team and the only reason I knew his orientation was because he had mentioned something about his boyfriend in casual conversation. 

Oh ya, and I forgot that the director of my division is a homosexual woman. Again, I only know that because she referred to her wife once, so it really doesn't seem like that big of a deal."
35bgeo,18,I think the replies in this topic are actually a pretty good example of the hostility and ignorance you can expect to encounter. But don't let that stop you - there are legal protections and there are companies with progressive cultures that would welcome you. It just may take longer to find a place worth staying at. 
35bgeo,18,"At my last internship it was a super diverse and welcoming environment. Female CEO, female head of engineering, female QA manager, several female developers, and a transgender woman on the technical support staff. I'm not sure how long the support woman had been presenting as female but I heard nothing but positive comments about the quality of her work. Nobody screwed up her pronouns, nobody brought up her transgender status. Overall the company felt very gender-balanced.

My team lead was also a Black French speaker from Africa, my QA lead was Middle Eastern, and the software engineering manager was Latino. It was nice not feeling like I was on some prime-time TV series surrounded by white men. The diversity felt realistic and comfortable for me, since my high school was super diverse.

I got lucky at that company but I think as ethnic diversity and gender/sexuality diversity gain importance and visibility, more companies will start to look like the company I worked at."
35bgeo,18,What does your orientation have to do with computer science or programming? Or how well you do your job? When is it even going to come up?
35bgeo,18,No one cares as long as you're a good developer.
35bgeo,18,Why do you need to present your gender at all? It's not something other people really care about.
35bgeo,18,"It may be awkward at stodgy government-contractor type companies like Lockheed Martin (or maybe not, I don't know), but who wants to work there anyways? It will be a rounding error at Silicon Valley area companies like Google/Apple/Facebook/Yahoo!, etc., or most startups in the area.

I knew a guy at Apple who sported a full beard and wore a dress every day. I also had the privilege to work with a woman who is universally recognized as one of the foremost authorities in her field of software, and who happens to be trans.

You will go as far as your technical ability can take you!"
4oeozr,4,"If you end up quitting to leave the state, I strongly suggest you let your boss know exactly why you're leaving.  Businesses that operate in Texas need to know that they're losing good people because of stupid bullshit like these bathroom laws.

That out of the way, take the offer!  It's better to work than to not work and you don't know what the situation will be in another year.

Good luck to you!"
4oeozr,4,"So what's the alternative? Being unemployed for however long waiting for a bill that *might* pass?

Just do it. And if it does happen then I'm sure people will understand. And if they don't, again, what's the alternative?"
