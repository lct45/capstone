help me understand what is going on with my attitude towards side projects,fcz7fg,mic4ael,8,1583289765.0,"hey everyone,  i am seeking some help with something that i have been struggling with for quite some time. many times i tried to come up with solutions and reasons to the problem but to no avail thus i have finally decided to ask reddit for help.  i am a software developer with more than 5 years of experience and i would describe myself as a fairly passionate developer. i know stuff, i read a lot about the topics that interest me, i read the code and research a lot (however i still think i am not as good of a developer as i could be).  i have noticed in the course of the last years that i have a problem starting my own side (pet) projects from scratch and actually practicing outside of my working hours. the problem is that i can't even start simple things, unless someone tells me what to work on. i noticed that e.g. i don't have this problem if someone challenges me or gives me a home assignment (e.g. job interview project). i really like programming and do know how beneficial side projects are but what is more important is that i want to do more programming which i really do like.  i want to change my attitude and start coding more after work. did anyone else experience something like that? if yes, how did you tackle it?  &#x200b;  random reflections:  1. am i lacking motivation maybe? 2. am i dealing with burnout? 3. sometimes i just can't come up with a nice idea for a project 4. initially i get excited about something just to lose this drive after a while  &#x200b;  regards"
mechanical engineer unsure about switching,fd0tj8,NumberOneSilver,9,1583295738.0,"hello everyone. i am a mechanical engineer in a manufacturing environment and it wears on me really badly. i feel more like glorified maintenance than an engineer. 90% of my job is filing requests for money for parts and then documenting every last bit about them. i don't find it challenging or rewarding, and i don't really feel like i get along with my coworkers much either.  but this is actually my third mechanical engineering job and i haven't liked any of them. while getting my college degree i taught several coding courses, including matlab, labview, vba, c#, and some minor ides like arduino. i was generally really good at it, i thought, and whenever i would code the day would fly by.  whenever i talk to my friends who quit engineering in college to do computer science, they are generally way more happy and their jobs sound much more challenging and fulfilling. but i can't tell if this is true or if it's just ""grass is greener"" syndrome.  the tldr of my post are these questions:  1) how should i go about switching? i live in a city with various code camps and i also know about the freecodecamp approach. i don't want to go back to school, my university would require me to re-take too many fluff classes.   2) would i be starting from zero on my career? i have around 4 years of experience in engineering and having to apply to internships scares me. i want to be saving money and building a career, taking a double digit paycut makes me apprehensive.  any advice at all would be extremely helpful. i feel very lost."

i'm a cs major who has to drop out of school. can i still get a job in programming or am i screwed?,fd0rhu,Tyce1427,3,1583295539.0,"like i said i'm a 22 year old cs student who is planning to drop out this semester. my transcript is horrible. i have failed and dropped *a lot* of classes, so i don't think that i can go back to school. the most i can see myself getting is an associates degree, but even that feels like a stretch since i would have to apply to a new school and i doubt i could get in. is there any associates degrees or maybe even some online certifications that i can do that will help me land an entry-level job?     i know basic c++ and ruby and i'm leaning towards becoming a web developer. i plan to learn more languages like html and javascript, but i'm not sure which ones i need and which ones i should learn first. what are some online resources that i could use to start learning?

certificate of data science vs certificate of computer science,fd96xa,microbial2,2,1583333574.0,"hello,  i'm a non-cs major graduating this may (double major in business analytics and finance) and my career goal is to be in data science.  while i picked up some knowledge of python, r, java, and a bit of sql as a part of my major in business analytics, i'm having trouble getting my foot in the door without a computer science degree.  my best current opportunity is that i have a friend who gave me a referral to a technology development program that's focused on software architecture but has short-term exit opportunities into data science.  i got rejected in this round of interviews but have been getting feedback from the organization/recruiter and plan on interviewing again in the fall.  my goal is to get the job in the fall. the feedback that i got from the head of the program is that i was a great culture fit but other candidates had more technical aptitude and i should work on side projects to develop my repertoire.  moving forward, getting a minor in cs would leave me in school until spring 2021, which just wouldn't be worth it logistically.  so, i'm going to graduate in may with my double major and have a couple of options to get myself the most prepared i can be by that fall interview and show some technical aptitude and get a project or two under my belt:  note that i'm currently trying to study out of an algorithms textbook that a friend had for his data structures course.  i'm really not sure how much progress i'll be able to make with this by the time i start the summer semester.  1. take program design i at my local community college (essentially intro to c++) over the summer and pursue a 4 month cs certificate at a university near me (in the certification program i'd complete data structures / application of algorithms, intro to object oriented programming, and intermediate object oriented development). 2. take program design i at my local community college (essentially intro to c++) over the summer and pursue a 6 month intro to data science certificate at a university near me (in the certification program i'd complete intro to database systems, dynamic programming languages (python), and data processing, visualization, and analysis.  this cert also has the option of doing a data science project for a non-profit organization under the guidance of a faculty member).  **my questions about my situation:**  &#x200b;  * which cert would make more sense?  i feel like the cs certification would give me a much better programming foundation and be an easier in for the job i'm pursuing in fall, and would also make it easier to get into entry level technical jobs with exit opportunities into data science.  on the contrary, i feel like the data science certification appeals directly to where i want to end up, but doesn't give me too much advantage when it comes to getting an entry level technical job with exit opportunities into data science.  &#x200b;  * how are certificates like the ones i describe perceived?  getting a second bachelors or a masters in cs would take me \~3 years and a lot more money.  the cs minor delays my graduation an entire year for a 6 course minor, which i don't think is worth it.  i would like to get a masters down the road but get some programming / data science experience first.  i feel like the certificate option gives me the opportunity to get exposure to the core cs classes and not tie myself down for years.  &#x200b;  * what types of projects should i be looking to do?  data analysis projects in python would probably look better for where i want to be, but projects in c++ / java could get me in the door this fall.  &#x200b;  tl;dr - trying to get into data science long-term, technology program short-term to take advantage of exit opportunities.  do i get certificate that provides exposure to core cs classes, which helps me for short-term opportunity, or get certificate that provides exposure to more data science courses and project experience, which helps my end goal?"

should i get out of embedded software field?,fdbxd6,Oasis_beyond_wall,4,1583351742.0,"hello everyone,  i am an embedded software programmer with about 1 year of work experience. i have been coding in pure c for embedded systems and my project experience was mainly focused on linux application layer coding (no driver, no kernel, no rtos experience).  according to the data from stack overflow, c programmers have very low income compared to other    programming languages such as python and javascript. there aren't as many jobs for embedded software developers either.  i feel like embedded software development is a bad choice if i want to continue my career as a programmer.  recently i was approached by a recruiter, asking if i am interested in a golang developer job, the job comes from a reputable it company, they will give me  time for me to learn golang while i am working there.   i do not consider programming as a hobby, so i won't feel sad if i leave embedded software field.  should i switch to golang and leave embedded software field? which one do you think is a better career path?  thank you,"

the case for utah,fde9op,chalcidfly,27,1583363156.0,"i have seen some interest on this sub recently regarding tech centers outside of sv/seattle/nyc/boston, so i thought i’d chip in with my two cents about my state — utah, or as some people call it “silicon slopes”. (yes, everyone knows it’s a stupid name, but we still use it.)  as fortune would have it, i am leaving utah to work in austin texas in a couple of months, so i will be totally honest about my experiences with companies here.  first of all, if you want a longer, more well written version of this post, check out this essay on medium: https://marker.medium.com/how-mormons-built-the-next-silicon-valley-while-no-one-was-looking-c50add577478  ok, now i will get to my thesis: in my experience, utah is a great place to build a (comparatively) low-profile, but still quite lucrative tech career in a highly affordable area.  there are two types of software companies that do very well here: b2b saas companies driven by charismatic sales leaders, and fintech (financial technology).  in the first category you have qualtrics (acquired by sap), domo, omniture (acquired by adobe), pluralsight, podium, lucid, and many others.  in the second category you have plaid (recently acquired by visa), divvy, mx, and a small handful of others. this is a much more “niche” category but growing.  sure, the next facebook won’t be coming out of utah any time soon, but a lot of startups here do get pretty huge and have big successful exits.  as for salaries: you won’t be making $250k in 5 years like you might at faang. but you can reasonably expect an entry level salary to come in around $80-100k. after ten years experience you could be pulling in $180k.  those numbers may not jiggle your panties, but keep in mind that starter homes go for around $250k, and really really nice homes might be closer to $500k. you could start a job right out of college and afford a decent sized home within just a couple years.  culturally, the provo-salt lake city area has heavy mormon influence but all that really translates to in reality is that the dating scene is probably meh if you’re not mormon, as there is a big focus on family and many people get married and have kids young. everything outside of slc itself is very much a sleepy suburbia feel. everyone leaves work by 5, dinner at 7, lights out by 10pm. personally i really like that style but may not be for everyone.  ok, now for some specific companies that i have insider knowledge on.  qualtrics: great place to work, excellent work life balance, reasonable advancement opportunities. they’ll try to convince you it’s a rocket ship (it’s not) but if you ignore the marketing hype it’s just a regular, good, profitable company that you will almost certainly never get fired from. entry level swe comes in at l3 at around $100k. you can expect to get promoted to l4 in 2-3 years and bump your salary to something like $120-$130. then another 3-5 years later, you’ll probably get promoted to l5 and command anywhere from $150 to $180. again, keep in mind that $180 basically gets you a mansion here.  plaid: no idea how it’s like after the visa acquisition but i interviewed there several months ago and it seemed incredible. they offered a shitload of money for entry level ($110k base plus $40k stocks per year at their previous valuation, which has since doubled). many of the engineers in their slc office are very young and all 30 of them basically report to the same person so there is a ton of room for career growth if you get in quick.  adobe: i have friends who have worked there and love it. from what i hear it’s not really growing and incoming headcount is low because no one ever quits, so it’s actually pretty hard to get in.  divvy: really interesting, exciting company that is growing super fast so lots of room for growth. they have a cool modern tech stack with elixir on the backend and react/graphql on the front end. (the company podium also uses elixir.) however their recruiters are unbelievably disorganized, so don’t get too discouraged by that. they’re building a big 5-story building near slc that they’re going to hire a ton of people to fill.  lucid: seemed sort of cool but not really my environment. everyone had a half-cubicle if you like that sort of thing. it’s also a windows/pc shop which is a minus for me because i’ve invested so much in the unix workstation stack. they offered me $88k. it didn’t seem incredibly “fun” and “dynamic” but fairly loose promotion structure so the right person could really make a splash. as an example their director of engineering is something like 5 years out of his masters degree and he started there as an entry level engineer.  domo: they are a pretty big deal around here but internally it’s kind of a shitstorm, but you can read all about that on forbes. i would stay away.  wework: just including this for kicks and giggles. they acquired a company here (teem) but then sold it after their dumpster fire of a failed ipo last year. they have me a verbal offer of 110-115 (their words) but paperwork failed to materialize after the company collectively shitted itself.  microsoft, ebay, snapchat, twitch, oracle: supposedly they have offices here, but i have never met anyone who works at any of these companies. my impression is that they only hire experienced developers, but i’m not sure about that. hats off to you if you make any inroads here.  as a counterpoint to the above companies, i have a friend who is working as a web developer for brigham young university who is making $65k, and that is the lowest salary i have heard of in this area.  if you’re into video game development, the places to know are avalanche (subsidiary of warner bros), chair  (subsidiary of epic games), and wild works. really not much else in that field besides those three.  some famous people who you may know from twitter who live in utah are: kent c dodds (react guru) and dave delong (former apple engineer).  happy to answer questions in the comments. there are a few other utah folks who lurk here that can offer their insights (and possibly corrections) as well."
how should i weigh internship offers to decide which to take?,fd7pgg,GreenOrdinary,3,1583325298.0,"i'm having a difficult time deciding between offers right now. i'm a computer science student in my third year. i receive an offer from nasa and one from fidelity through their leap program, both for doing software engineering. i don't know what to do since i am drawn to name recognition and prestige of company which at first glance nasa seems better. but looking further into the opportunities, nasa doesn't have a great internship program. they pay very little and can't let interns work on any large or valuable projects since they're a government facility. fidelity seems to have a nice internship program for their interns and pays better.  how should i be weighing offers? i do have a few final interviews i'm finishing up and will probably need help weighing them if i get any more offers. the only thing that's important to me is what's going to look good and help me in the long run since i'll be applying to full time positions shortly after the summer."
"can’t find company’s developer salaries online, does this mean i will be low balled?",fcistw,niceguy7326,2,1583211274.0,"company i’m about to interview with doesn’t have any salaries for software developer or it positions online (glassdoor, etc.). does this mean that the likelihood of being lowballed/offered a low salary will increase? this is for a junior java developer position and since i have multiple internships with fortune 500 companies, i’m not wanting to take a low paying position. i’m willing to interview, but i’m concerned about this in general."
grad student - got two job offers while working on my start-up. what should i do?,fcv5yc,practically-homeless,52,1583273766.0,"sorry for the wall of text, but context is important.  i want to preface by saying that i have a different mentality to most people. i grew up very poor and have had days when i didn't eat anything, and i also suffer from adhd which has made defeating my procrastination extremely difficult at times. about a year ago, i had no income whatsoever and lived on about 2 dollars each day - and ended up being evicted as well. if my girlfriend didn't put in so much effort to take care of me, i would've probably have committed suicide.  fast forward now a year, and i am currently studying for my master's degree in machine learning at a top university ranked within the top 20 worldwide in computer science (my tuition is paid for by the government, as i live in a scandinavian country). i also managed to get myself a part-time job, working remotely for a us company and i make about 150 usd / hour doing data science consulting.  by working just 2 hours each day, i make about 7000-8000 dollars each month - which is what senior developers make here in my country for the big companies (google, microsoft, etc). i live extremely frugally and am saving almost everything. my monthly expenses amount to about 800 usd (renting a small dorm in a bad neighborhood with the occasional gunshots outside, food, gym since bodybuilding is my only hobby, and transportation to get to school). i don't drink or smoke or eat out, since this city has high col.  now, my current dilemma. i decided to start a company regarding utilizing ai in the commerce industry. i am not going to pitch it here, but just take my word for it when i say that the success is entirely dependent on execution and there is a strong market for this service. with that said, i am approached by recruiters daily, but i always ignore them until recently. two consultancy firms approached me.  both are very renowned and big companies. one is mckinsey & co., and the other is the biggest national consultancy firm in my country. former wants me to enter a mid-level position as a data science consultant, and the latter is starting up their new ai department so as to offer ai services to their clients, and they want me to be their lead ai consultant. both will pay above market price for respective positions.  this is crazy to me, as currently the machine learning industry is really saturated by a lot of students who freshly graduated - and so it's very difficult to get an internship or a junior position. some of my classmates have been trying to get an internship for months, and they are being rejected all the time - despite having gone to a great university and gotten great grades. one of my classmates even had **yoshua bengio** as her thesis advisor / supervisor! the situation is crazy competitive.  whereas i am offered a huge shortcut. both employers are willing to give me the flexibility i need to finish my master's degree, and about a month of mandatory paid leave each year.  at the same time, i realize that if i want financial freedom (which is important to me, due to my adhd), i need to start this company i am working on along with a team. even if i earn 200k+ usd, i can not see myself retiring early while able to provide a comfortable life for my future family. just the thought of working 9 to 5 for 40+ years is giving me a lot of anxiety. that's so much time lost from not spending time with those i love before they die or before i die. just the thought of that sentence makes me want to cry. the time we spend with those that love us is priceless. i love my girlfriend, my mother, my sister, and my close friends so much. so much more than they realize, and i feel guilty that i don't spend as much time with them as they want me to - because i don't know when any of us might die. i keep thinking about death every single hour. fuck, now i'm crying.  i've already invested more than 10k usd into my start-up. and if i decide to drop this and pursue entrepreneurship later; i am not sure if i will get an idea that is this good again - as i don't want to shoehorn myself into entrepreneurship. i just don't know what to consider here.  i am really just asking for thoughts and opinions, especially from more experienced people. i feel lost on what to do."

what would the ideal job look like to you?,fd11li,Minderella_88,4,1583296601.0,i am part of a small dev community and our region suffers from brain drain (decent local university produces developers but many of them move away after graduating). so i was wondering what would the ideal remote job or local job look like?
"just started first job out of college in a devops role, how productive am i supposed to be?",fd5is0,madmax299,6,1583315143.0,"tldr; great team, great project, good pay, steep learning curve. never did devops. i'm in my second week and the stack is complicated, full of customization, and poorly documented. am worried about needing too much hand holding. i am three days into some minor edits to deployment port configs and been learning lots everyday but still feel like either i suck or the stack is complicated.  i consider myself able to learn just about anything and a quick learner but have started feeling some anxiety about my performance in my first dev job. the company is pretty lax and ppl say it takes a lot to get fired. money doesn't seem tight for my team.  i am doing devops, the deployment stack contains kubernetes, helm, openshift, rancher, quarkus, and prob some other things i haven't dealt with yet. after a week of dev env setup(waiting for permissions and some hiccups in docs), i have been given two assignments, both dealing with how ports are exposed. while i get the idea of what needs to be done, and understand how most of the bug pieces work. i am having trouble with details. things like setting up for local testing, where to find info in the large repo, and other random errors in a lot of stuff i am trying. i google around and sometimes i get it done on my own, but about 50% of the time i get stuck and ask for help from another dev assigned to help me.  he's been doing devops here for 2 years so he usually spots my issue quickly. i ask for help maybe 5 or 6 times a day, which usually takes about 10 min of his time. is this too much hand holding? no one has hinted at this but i want to avoid any negative perception.  realistically, how capable should i be at something i didn't learn in school and have no experience with?"

"sos: wrong job, or wrong attitude?",fd0o1r,Hairy_Noodles,4,1583295179.0,"hello everyone,  i’ve been lurking here for quite some time, and decided to finally make a profile and post. this is a very long rant with questions at the end. you have been warned.  # some background.  i graduated in 2018 with a degree in electronic engineering at a uk university. i have a 4.0 gpa and even managed to work as an applications engineer for 12 months between my 2nd and 3rd year to gain some experience.  in my final year of university, i found my interest in electronics fading. i just couldn’t see myself pouring over niche datasheets for a chip manufactured in china that probably won’t exist in 2-3 years, or designing a power rectification circuit for a 240v dildo, so i decided to make a career switch into cs. programming seems to be less about “knowing” unchanging designs and chips, and more about creativity and problem solving, which i love. it also seems like a far more flexible and dynamic career. over the next 6 months after graduating, i taught myself c, python, java, and a bit of c++. i then taught myself how to git and uploaded some personal projects to github as my portfolio.  7 months after graduating, i landed my first job as an embedded software engineer at a startup in a major uk city, and promptly got fired after 4 months. the reason can be summed up as ""curiosity killed the cat""  # my current situation.  i’m now working at a much larger company where i am the only software engineer on the entire site of 300 people. i’m in a room with myself and my manager, who is not a software engineer but a very talented electronics engineer.  my task is to design, develop, test and implement a complex embedded project from scratch in 12 months. i’ve been there for 5 months and i feel absolutely lost in this project, and i can’t seem to make any progress. if i had to distill my issues they would be:  * there is absolutely no direction or plan laid out for the project. there is no idea of what should be accomplished, when, or how. i have tried to organize my own thoughts on trello and break down the problems into smaller tasks, but the project’s scope has kept creeping for the past month, rendering a lot of my plans useless. i have tried asking for help on the developer forums of the particular platform i’m using but this can only go so far and doesn’t help me develop an entire architecture, which brings me to…. * i feel overwhelmed with the scope of the project. at the startup i would gladly accept a small part of the project, then code it to absolute perfection. here however, i’m having a lot of trouble both organizing the entire direction of the project, organizing the entire software architecture, exploring the api functionality for my tasks, exploring the api of “nice-to-have” features which we aren’t even close to implementing, actual coding, debugging, and so on. all this is occurring as my manager keeps discussing new features before we even have a baseline prototype. * no infrastructure. there’s no version control, and due to some security issues, we have to go through the most roundabout method to install one. after months of begging it, we’ve been given a windows server to play with, and my manager has suggested that we vnc into it, use hyper-v on the windows server to create an ubuntu server, then setup a git server on that. i had no idea how to do this, and while messing around with network switches i accidentally tanked the windows server. after apologizing to it and having them fix it again, i'm now back at square one. i’d research into this to figure it out , but i have no idea how long i'll have to drop my normal tasks to get this done. i’d argue with my manager on a better solution to implement version control, but i don’t have the experience or knowledge to present a good argument to her. * being the only software engineer is incredibly lonely. i have no one to bounce ideas off of, and i don’t know what i don’t know. bouncing ideas off my manager is a terrible idea, as she defaults to a 45-minute, one-sided, stream-of-consciousness brainstorming session that ends up being a cognitive assault which leaves me utterly overwhelmed and exhausted. * i don’t know how much this should factor in to my feelings or performance on the job, but i simply don’t care or see the point of the particular product we’re making. we’re making an inferior version of something which has been made 200 times before. this product only exists as a last ditch attempt by this company - which is very old fashioned - to stay relevant in today’s market.  i addition to the above, i’ve gone through a string of major life changed and a few tragedies including the loss my best friend from university, and a relationship that fell through. it’s been about 2 months now and i feel somewhat stable, though i’m far from “ok”. for reasons beyond my control i also need to financially support my parents for the time being until they can get back on their feet, so just quitting is not an option i have.  i’ve tried becoming hyper focused and getting some coding done, but i quickly lose momentum after a few days when i have to rethink the high level planning of the whole project, or when my manager blasts me with a non-consensual brainstorming session, that leaves me mentally exhausted and confused.  i’ve tried going into autopilot mode, but it’s difficult to do when you’re the sole developer of a project, and your manager sits just 1.5m from you. i’ve started procrastinating way more than i’m proud of, and my mental well-being and productivity have sunk to all-time lows. a few weeks ago i think i did maybe 1-2 hours of actual work the entire week.  i'm not learning, if anything i'm losing a lot of the valuable skills i developed during my 4 months at the startup. i just can't seem to revitalize my work ethic, and i can't seem to get the project back on track. i'm stressed out my mind and i'm starting to experience bouts of depression.  # questions  has this happened to anyone at all? i’m 26 now, and i’m not sure if this level of resignation and stress is just a normal phase of adult working life, or am i experiencing something different? should i just suck it up and do my job, or should i start looking elsewhere? any and all suggestions will be appreciated.  i apologies sincerely for the rant, but i needed to get this off my chest. thank you for reading,   hairy\_noodles"
current internship boss told me i'm not a natural.,fcphh8,veggievoid,5,1583240000.0,"but he said i have the potential to be a natural. compared to other interns, i'm not the best, but i'm not the worst. i'm average. this was his opinion (which i asked for) during a review session.  for background, i'm an mis student. i'm probably a better programmer than 90% of other mis students, and my minor is in computer science. with that said, what my boss said is 100% true, this doesn't come natural to me, it takes me longer to work through a problem than say, a cs or a ce student. i don't have quite the exposure they've had, as the most advanced programming class i've taken is data structures & algorithms. but i enjoy what i do, and i always work through any problem to the best of my ability. i'm familiar with quite a few frameworks and languages, i've done front-end, back-end, and full stack. i've got a couple app dev internships under my belt, with cumulatively a year's worth of experience on top of my degree.  with that said, based on this assessment, how likely am i to succeed in a full time position as a junior app developer? getting close to graduation and worrying about competing with ""superstars"" who could probably kick my butt in a technical interview."

(2) i'm also not a fan of preparing for 3 days and memorizing information that can be easily googled or found in the docs.  (3) i'm also not a fan of crash learning stuff that i didn't mention on my resume and have clearly stated i don't know. i feel like it would be a dick move to present me with technology i'm not familiar with, combined with (2) and (1) it would turn out to be a disaster.  the thing is - i need a new job asap, i can't imagine myself doing it for any other reason, at the same time i want to stay proffessional, calm and not to appear like a donkey. i like the guy who interviewed me - a very open-minded and well-spoken person,  hr people are great too.  all three things i've mentioned are basically a deal-breaker for me. i want to attend the interview despite not having any info on these issues.  **i want to ask you guys - how would you react to save face in this situation?** i don't want to sit for hours forcing myself to complete the test. if any of these issues come up(maaaaaaaybe except 1) i just want to piss off and spend this time more productively.  &#x200b;  edit:  ^(the worst thing that can happen - all three issues come up.)  ^(the best thing that can happen - none of these come up, it's a simple test that can be completed in 2 hours tops.)  ^(that's why i want to attend anyway.)"

dealing with a mix of impostor syndrome and the paradox of choice,fdcqub,Dralafi_XIII,4,1583356047.0,"let me explain: in a couple of months, assuming things go well, i will be graduating from a no-name school with a bachelors in computer science (cs). obviously cs is very broad and covers a lot of things dealing with computers, including it, software engineering, devops, cyber security, etc. it was always my hope that as i went through school one particular career would speak out to me more than the others, and that would be the one i would focus on post-college. unfortunately, that never really happened.  i'm currently set with a full-time position that will be waiting for me upon graduation in cyber security (the pay is quite good even though i have no certs), but, to be honest, my heart's not really in it. it will however buy me time to figure out what it is i really want to do and where it is i really want to go.  i've laid out my main career options in my head as follows:   (1) software engineering. i think i want to do software engineering most of all, but i have massive impostor syndrome with this. my grades in school aren't the greatest, right around 3.0, so i worry i may not have the aptitude. it's one of the reasons i have a cyber security job as opposed to a software engineering one; maybe i'm just not cut out for software engineering? even if i go into it, i probably should go full-stack, and explore the field. however, i have a family, and worry that things could go south if i don't land myself into a job right away. since there's too much risk in it, i have applied for only a few jobs here and there, and only one callback as of last week.   (a) i'll be getting \~$65k for my cyber job. would taking a pay cut (only getting $40-60k) be worth it in the long run, i.e. for better opportunities down the road?   (2) devops. i have network and sysadmin experience, so i've always thought quite generally that since devops bridges the gulf between development and operations, this might be more up my alley. however, anything that i do, especially post-graduation, will be strictly on my own. there's nothing in my school to give me any information about it, and so it just felt too risky. not to mention, what if i go down that road and end up not liking that either?   (3) cyber security. i already have a job i'm starting in june. my company is willing to pay for me to get my masters (either in cs or cyber, but they'd like me to go cyber), and though they are willing to pay for certs, they will only pay for certain certs. out of the three above, this is the safest option. i already work for my company part-time, and i've thought about how i'd like it doing what i'm doing now but full-time, and the short answer: i wouldn't. i ask myself: would i like to continue doing what i'm doing now, full-time, for five years? what about 10? how about 20? i can see doing five if i had to, but i worry that doing that would also set me back in another potential career field.  long-term for any of these: i live in ga, and am hoping to stab westward towards the west coast as i progress in my career.  i'm feeling a little too much like piglet from winnie the pooh; ""oh, what to do, what to do...?""  any advice or suggestions?"

my career path was hijacked and i have no idea what to do,fcw70t,,19,1583278187.0,"i have been a mobile developer for almost 4 years now and i love it. i'm very comfortable with native android, ios, xamarin, and flutter. when i got this job i was asked to replatform an application from native to flutter so i figured this would be perfect and since i would be the only mobile guy i thought it was a dream come true, which it was, until i finished it. after i finished the application and it was released i was essentially told that now i am responsible for maintaining the application, the api for the application, and i was going to be spending the majority of my time working on web front end. i was told i will be getting a new title, something that reflects web front end and that i will be mainly doing that while i simultaneously maintain a separate api and mobile application.  im pissed because i was completely blindsided by this and i really have no desire to switch to web front end. also why would someone hire a mobile developer if they are just going to reassign them to web after the application is complete? why not just hire a contractor?  im grateful that i get to learn new things, but i really have no desire to switch from mobile to web, especially since there is still so much left for me to learn on the mobile side. so aside from ""stop being a little bitch"", what should i do?  edit: im getting my job title changed to front end web developer so this is a permanent thing, not just helping out on the web side for a sprint or two."
being forced to use a particular language for coding assessment,fcrbnw,NeverJustaDream,5,1583250618.0,"what do you guys think about the practice? it's a language i haven't used in a while that will be used during the internship, but like i don't know if i'm gonna get the internship. i don't think it's reasonable to force a candidate to use one language since this would add extra time to refresh on syntax and libraries, potentially just for that coding assessment. i feel like your problem solving skills should be much more important than being able to use a particular language."

would i be making a mistake declining this offer?,fd98x8,FaustWasHere,4,1583333906.0,"i just recently graduated and have been trying to land a c++ job.   recently i got an offer from a small company and i would be the second c++ developer. problem is, i don't think i am good enough at the language to warrant the hire, i think they might consider me better than what it is in reality.    the technical interview we had was so basic (only asking me what's the difference between references and pointers, difference between c++ and c), so i don't think they have a fair assesment of my skills and i am worried i will be expected to do a lot more than i can handle, especially since it's a small company and i will most likely work on a project all by myself.   any advice?"
is it normal to have nothing to do?,fczj28,eagle_bearer,3,1583290975.0,"so the company i'm currently at doesn't really have a lot of activity, and the little it has is already covered by other devs.   i'm just here browsing reddit, occasionally doing some testing or fixing minor bugs, and whenever i ask my boss for something to do he just asigns me something to test/fix, which can be easily done in under 20 minutes.  the company is very small, we're eight in total, and half (including me) are students working part-time. they kind of leave the boring, easy and repetitive stuff to us while they take care of the important work, and honestly that's okay for me since i'm just getting started as a programmer and have basically no experience, but most of the time there's literally nothing to be done and it feels like i'm wasting my time and i'm not even getting enough money for it.  i'm considering leaving, but wanted to ask here if it's normal to just have nothing to do or is it something that happens only on small companies?"
how hard is it to switch paths post-entry-level?,fd43gh,VorreiRS,2,1583308777.0,"ultimately, i would like to be a systems software engineer. ever since i learned c i have been in love. i am a senior in college about to graduate and have been having trouble finding an entry-level systems job. how bad for my career (long-term) would it be if i got a job doing ios developing, or any other unrelated area of developing?  &#x200b;  p.s. i have been very hesitant to even think about other types of jobs, because it seems like if i get experience in an unrelated field, and spend time away from c, i will have no chance to change later."
i have realised that i don't like coding and now i just do it to make some money and i don't know what else to do.,fcx6fu,diabapp,12,1583282046.0,i have been coding for 7 years now and finally i realised i don't like it and i don't want to do it. the problem is i don't know what else to do. i have some public speaking skill and i like technology. i have explored the option of community evangelist and developer advocate. they seem intersting to me right now the other option is being an entrepreneur which i like. can you guys suggest me some other options which i can explore given my areas of interest?  p.s : i am looking at learning new skills and be really good at what i do so that i can achieve financial freedom in life.

second bachelors vs masters field change,fde691,Aeramyl,2,1583362768.0,"i've seen this topic here before, but i wanted to get advice with my current situation.  i currently have a bs in marketing from a reputable school in massachusetts, but am looking to switch to switch fields to cyber security due to feeling stuck, and looking at a field that really interests me. i was not the best student and my grades were subpar which was manly personal issues and lack of focus.  my current employer has a list of programs (bachelors and masters) from accredited universities across the country that they will pay for everything up front and you are able to earn 1 bachelors and 1 masters through this program. so money isn't really an issue since it's all funded. the masters programs mostly require 2.5 gpa (i think i have) but am worried that i would miss the basics to be able to do well in the masters or that the masters are more theory based and miss some of the practical stuff. the school for bachelors (perdue global) seems more impressive than any of the masters we have offered (bellvue university seems like a better one?).   thoughts?"

moving to a freelance remote web dev job,fdcr3l,sokafootball,2,1583356083.0,"hi everyone.   i am 34 and work in italy as a junior it consultant / project manager for an it / communication agency.   i still have the itch of doing programming as my main job and do it remotely.   i have a basis of web development (basically finished cole steele advanced course, so html, css, js, react and bits of backend stuff) but i have never applied those skills to a real job and would probably need to get some practice after not doing any of that stuff for almost 3 years.   i'm thinking that a possible plan would be to get back to coding in my free time (mostly weekends, so like 6-8 hours a week), take some small freelance work in a few months once i'm ready and then evaluate whether it's a viable path. also my girlfriend is getting slowly into graphic design and ux and also would like to work from home, so it's a possibility that we could work together and splitting our responsabilities, especially since i'm not that much into ux/ui design.   so here are my questions:   1)do you think it is viable to work as a self employed web developer from home?   2)if so, would you recommend me doing the odin project to get back to coding and do some real projects? (i would probably rush through the basic html and css stuff)   3)would you recommend learning how to develop websites in wordpress? i have heard it accelerates the process for simple websites and can handle the back end side easily.     thanks for all the help :)"

international student in korea,fcupes,Thenoobster1123,4,1583271636.0,"i am currently a senior in high school about to go to college starting next semester. i am also a korean national without us citizenship. i also want to work in the us. i just had a quick question about which path you believe would be more helpful to my career.   after getting a bachelors in cs, i have basically 2 routes due to my mandatory korean military service. i can choose to go to military service for 1 1/2 years and postpone my career, then proceed to work in the us with a typical career path. however, i can also opt to substitute my military service as a government defense contractor for 3 years, which i could use as work experience. however, i would have to do a masters in cs/ml/data science immediately after my bachelors, then go into a 3 year job in korea.  my question is whether the second option would be a big plus or not, as it is guaranteed job experience, but i would also have to start my actual career pretty late due to getting a masters/3 years in korea.  any help would be appreciated!"
