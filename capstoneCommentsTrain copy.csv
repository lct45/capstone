(here is the fun part) if i am in the store with her and the store is ""progressive"", they point out that they have segregated ""men's nights"" or ""guys crafting nights"" that i could join, where guys are encouraged to show up with very few women around.   i don't know how to convince people to treat everyone equal (regardless of situation). unfortunately, you may have to keep looking, and not be afraid to ask tough questions during any future interviews you have. remember, you are interviewing them as much as they are you.",positive,positive,negative

crrqtfe,t3_381e1k,208,"hi op, sorry to hear about your troubles.  i'm a guy, so keep that in mind.   problem is, people assume you have no idea what you're doing, until you prove them wrong. (i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let matt handle this.)  i joined my current company last year and i feel the same way about my workplace. everyone else has a few more years experience at this company and a lot more overall years of experience. i haven't had this issue in any other job before. so what i'm suggesting is that you have gotten a bad group of people like myself and it may not be a gender thing, although that is how it might feel. (i don't know either way, just suggesting that there are alternative issues maybe).   and then even after that, if i happen to do something faster/cleaner than someone, the reply i often get is something along the lines of 'wow you did it faster. i must have really fucked up.'  this to me at least sounds like an issue of the new person making the old person look bad. in any case this is a really shitty thing to do. you could take something like this to heart and get upset about it, or you could joke around with them and not let it bother you. this will do a couple things, it will show them you won't let their comments bother you, it will also show them that you are their to work and threaten their positions in the company(depending on how they take it). you don't have to be a jerk or mean or anything, just throw light jabs that will bruise them or embarrass them.    there have been several cases where they were wrong, and i said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because i should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.  depending on when and how you correct them it could piss them off easily. if you are in a meeting with everyone on your team and you point out even the obvious mistake, this would embarrass that person easily. the trick is to point out the mistake, not lay blame though. this may be easier said then done. your wording is key as well, don't go hey sam you made a mistake here and i corrected it. it should be softer like, i was fixing this problem and i found something that i thought could be written like this and changed it. or something to that affect. its not a mistake you corrected, its a better way of doing it.   so the question is, how do i get past that people who don't know me immediately assume i don't know what i'm doing, and how do i be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?  i completely believe you when you say you are feeling gender related issues, i saw it in school, i see it in my current workplace. however i think the issues you describe are parts a) level of experience and b) ass-hole co-workers.  if you arn't asserting yourself as an expert when you speak, your body language etc. then people will see the opportunity to walk over you.   just speak with confidence, have research to back you up if you think its needed, do your work as good as you can.  be ready to take the hits sometimes and when you see the opportunity be ready to give them out. again, you don't need to be malicious about it.  lastly,   for clarity, 'matt' joined around the same time (a month later than i did), but there was more confidence in him and other guys who started around the same time  does matt have more real world experience then you? is his education university while yours is college? is matt bonding better with his co workers then you? does his job naturally involve more complicated and complex work then yours?  there are a billion reasons why matt might be treated better then you or anyone else on your group. you need to think about what the differences are between you two. gender is one, probably small issue of that.   i got treated very poorly at my old job because everyone else on the floor had bachelor degrees (or higher) and i had a college degree and pretty fresh at that. i turned that around through my attitude and work. you can close some gaps in the workplace, its a matter of identifying each persons issue with you and addressing it.   hope any of that helps you.",negative,positive,negative

(i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let matt handle this.)  it takes a while for people to trust you - you have to prove yourself constantly, not just once, for a while, to get ""automatic respect"" in this sense. as for matt having it, it could that he has a better background  (more years of experience before you, worked at a larger company, etc) so some people might put more weight on that, like having an ex-googler or fb engineer on the staff vs. a bunch of recent graduates with no much experience - even if they started at the same time in the company, a manager will put more trust on whoever has more experience. with that, that can level out, if you perform well.   'wow you did it faster. i must have really fucked up.'  that could be interpreted in two ways (depends on the tone of voice and the person) so i can't judge it - it could be a condescending comment (like ""i must have really fucked up if even you were able to do it faster"") or it could be a self-deprecating comment (""you were able to do this much faster than i could - i must've really missed something very obvious"").   there's another experienced (female) se who's really good at what she does, and i've noticed that people are condescending towards her sometimes too.. (mocking her for little things)  again depends on tone - se is a boy's club, for better or for worse, and this little mocking and condescension is common even among males, specially if there's a friendly atmosphere. in a way, the more you're mocked (if playfully) the more you're belonging to the group. you know how men will mock and curse at each other but it's all play? this could be it, but more subtle.    problem is, there's always some indignation and resentment if i happen to do something faster or correct someone. there have been several cases where they were wrong, and i said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because i should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.  then it's their fault they can't handle their ego getting hurt - just keep doing your thing and doing it well and you'll be respected in time, even if they don't show it in a way you might expect.   so the question is, how do i get past that people who don't know me immediately assume i don't know what i'm doing  you don't - people will tend to assume you don't know what you're doing by default, unless you are a very very nerd-looking asian with a ti-84 in your shirt's pocket, or you come with some pre-selection (like another trusted engineer in the team vouching for you and saying you're great). it's just how humans are wired and process stereotypes - we're still not used to seeing woman in cs, let alone women that are *great* at it. just give it time and keep giving your best and you'll prove yourself over time. cs is a meritocracy, so you have to earn your merit, it is not given to you by default for no particular reason... so just keep doing what you're doing.  a great way to break the ""taboo"" too is to get a big project (like the one they gave ""matt"") where people doubt you can make it - then you go and make it brilliantly. you won't be doubted a second time, and if you are, you can refer to the *big project* that you did as reference, then there won't be a third time.   and how do i be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?  that's a tricky one. it is not a gender thing and it is - men will get pissed when their egos get hurt because another guy did something amazingly better than them... and it can hurt extra if they are outperformed by a woman (just like it would extra suck for a man to lose at arm wrestling to a girl). you can't control other people's emotions, but you can keep doing your thing and eventually they will adapt and get used to it and quit getting pissed. it's not your fault they're getting pissed, it's their own problem (due to their ego) so there isn't much that you can do.  what i would do in your shoes is try to show them you're not out to get them or [explicitly] compete with them - for example, tell one of your coworkers that you would like their opinion on something. show them a problem you have and the solution you came up with and ask their opinion, if they think it will perform well, if they can think of a way for it to perform better, etc. this will tell them you are not out to compete, but that you're not helpless either because you're not asking for *help*, you already solved the problem, you're just asking their *opinion* - this puts both of you on level ground, as equals, and also shows them that you value their opinion and that you are looking to collaborate, not compete... then thank them for their input and that's it. just make sure your solution is actually really good (so he won't scratch the whole thing out and come up with something much better) or it can backfire (make you out to be incompetent).",neutral,positive,negative

(also i have worked with indian teams where it is not true at all, and indian teams with a close to 50/50 gender balance). i have worked with indian teams where male developers will be outright rude to female developers,  and this is a bit more frequent than i would accept as random chance of having rude people in the team. * there is a whole lot of support available for women/mothers in technology, which i guess in itself is a bit discriminatory as why should it be specific to gender? but, as per my previous comment on the pros and cons, it's nice that it's there if you need it.

(btw, why do we get shit for ""talking black"", but other races or nationalities don't get shit for speaking in a foreign language?). imo i would follow my path, and speak the queen's english at first. once your coworkers see you as ""one of them"" you're done. you'll never recover.   the whole ""talking black"" thing bit me in the butt at my last job. i let my guard down a little too early and paid the price later on. i eventually got fired from that job, not because i was black, but i'm certain that me letting my guard down had something to do with it.   here's the story: you know when you first meet someone and you're very formal and stiff because you don't know the person well? well, after i let my guard down i could literally see my (white) manager's reaction go from very formal to ""hey brotha, what's goin' down?"" i really didn't like that, and i didn't like him because he was a micromanaging know-nothing that thought he was a genius. this guy was a dick, and we didn't share a sense of humor, so long story short when it came time to make a decision on my future i am certain that because he saw me as ""one of them"" the decision was easy.   as a educated black working professional you'll second-guess yourself frequently. you don't want to be that person that blames everything on racism, but what if it was. how can you tell? you'll learn over time, that's the only advice i can give you in that regard.   i would recommend trying to find a mentor that shares your background. when i got my first job out of college (not a programmer) i had some older black ladies looking out for me and trying to show me the ropes. because i was young and inexperienced i didn't really understand the gravity of what they were trying to do for me. they warned me about some people and gave me advice. listen to your mentor's advice.    this has been long and rambling, and i don't really care to proofread or edit b/c i have to get back to work now. if you need clarification or extra details comment below and i'll be happy to reply.",negative,positive,negative

dfjusaa,t3_622ddy,35,"tell them, they can't really do anything about it since it will be super - ultra - big discrimination.  also you will have a clean conscious.  also, for the record, you *will* be less productive than you normally are, so don't push yourself too much.",blank,,
dfjvq90,t3_622ddy,35,it's an internship - you will be fine!   i have a 1 year old son and worked up until i was 37 weeks pregnant with him then burnt my annual leave. the good news is that assuming you stay low risk the only adjustment you might need is some extra back support in your chair - i never found working a serious hardship even at 30+ weeks along.,blank,,
dfjvt3o,t3_622ddy,35,"like others have said, feel no obligation to tell them beforehand and just show up. but i'd like to offer a different viewpoint:  an internship is more than just an opportunity to gain work experience. while your employer is evaluating you, you should be evaluating them!  any place that does not treat you as an equal due to your gender is not a place you want a full time job at.   as for telling people at work: treat it just like you would with potential friends. my coworkers share when they are engaged, expecting babies, going on vacations, etc. workplaces are much more enjoyable when you build connections and friendships with your coworkers. don't feel you need to hide your pregnancy. if you're excited about it and want to share / discuss, go ahead.  personal side note: the whole idea of having to fit a pregnancy into your lunch hours is garbage. i realize this is more an issue with living and working in america. but i would strongly encourage you to hunt down organizations that are offering fair paternity and maternity  leave packages. the only way to really drive change is to reward companies (with your employment) that have hr policies in line with the majority of first world nations rather than the current backwards archaic policies that are often the norm in usa.",blank,,
dfkbiqi,t3_622ddy,35,"first of all, congratulations!  in my personal opinion: absolutely don't tell them. why? because even though you may (or not, depending on all sorts of factors, from how your employment is categorized to the size of your company) be entitled to certain legal protections due to your pregnancy and also due to any issues you may have, proving discrimination is insanely hard. so, just don't even give them a chance to try and discriminate in advance. there's a great chance that they might be shitty about it, and there's also a great chance that there's no logical reason for them to do so. i worked until the last weekday before my baby was born with zero problem, and same goes for many women who have non-physical jobs.",blank,,
dfkgpo2,t3_622ddy,35,"i'm a software developer, at 36 weeks now. i don't have any useful advice really, since i'm working in europe. but i did want to express  solidarity; you're not the only one.   each pregnancy varies, so a lot of it just depends on how your body does. i haven't had many issues, but my job is also fairly chill, at 40 hours a week. on the other hand, my colleague had to stop a few months early and go on bed rest.   if i were you, i'd wait until a little closer to your internship, and give the recruiter a heads up that you're pregnant. it's a little bit out of respect for the company (or at least, to make you look responsible), and a little bit cya. ironically, while you're pregnant, they'll have a harder time justifying firing you, since it's such an easy discrimination suit.   on a non-professional note, i would leave time to take care of yourself. i've cut down on networking events and stopped taking extra classes. if you've got the money, you should absolutely take it easy - hire a cleaner, buy pre-made foods, let yourself lounge on the couch all saturday.  best of luck, and i hope you have a happy, healthy baby.",blank,,

dfjtku8,t1_dfjeoig,35,"key word here is 'should'. even though it is very illegal in practically all western countries, there is a significant amount of threads from women that got screwed by their employer in /r/babybumps. i have faced this discrimination too.   better safe than sorry.",blank,,

dfji0vr,t1_dfjeoig,35,100%.  i see absolutely no reason to not give them advance warning that you might need to take some time off.,blank,,
dfkaeyu,t1_dfjeoig,35,"it's illegal to discriminate based on pregnancy, but realistically if your performance sucks as a result of being pregnant that's the thing they're going to get you for. it would be very difficult to prove whether it's because you're pregnant or because you're perpetually sucking at your job because of the toll pregnancy takes on your body.   my wife has been pregnant three times, the third with twins but aside from that they've been relatively routine. by 34 weeks with the first pregnancy she fully admitted that she was pretty much useless at work. with the third pregnancy it was so bad that **i** started being useless at work because of all the extra assistance she understandably needed.   it's an unpopular opinion but the idea that mothers can expect to be 100% productive all throughout their pregnancy is a fucking joke. employers expecting it is wrong and women trying to fulfill it and buying into 'superhero mom' bullshit is wrong too. on the other hand, it's unreasonable to expect an employer to tolerate a huge drop in production without setting expectations first. it's a shame we don't have proper parental leave like the rest of the civilized world.",blank,,
dfkbpho,t1_dfjtl5y,35,"this is the correct answer imo. it seems like a lot of people itt are under the misapprehension that just because something is illegal, it's either impossible for a company to do, or they won't risk it. on the contrary, i think most companies realize that many types of discrimination are very hard to prove, so they just don't care about avoiding it. and even if the company as a whole cares in some sense, an individual recruiter or manager may not.  i would not tell them. i didn't even tell my boss at the job where i already worked until i was late in the second trimester.",blank,,
dfkdzzs,t1_dfj9woo,35,"yeah, i mean, plenty of folks take off for appointments (or ""i'm busy from 2-3pm). i just wouldnt even mention it past that! best luck in your internship! that definitely must complicate it for you.",blank,,
dfjuqug,t1_dfjtzpq,35,"it was something along the lines of:   ""what? you know you can't ask that right? but no, i'm not"". (this was two years ago).   and later during the ""do you have any questions?"" phase i asked him if he planned on having kids. then turned red because that is such an inappropriate question to ask.  the thing is though, it was a teeny-tiny startup (i would be the 3rd person) and they were looking for a lead developer. they really couldn't have afforded to hire me and have me be gone for a significant amount of time within the next 6 months. i'm pretty sure he knew he shouldn't ask, thought about it, but considered the risk of me suing them over it was worth it. he was clearly embarrassed when asking. and to be honest, in their position, i think i would have done the same, which is why i never made it a thing, but definitely kept it in my mind when i recently interviewed again while i was actually pregnant.",blank,,
dfk4ajy,t1_dfjuqug,35,"edit: only relevant to america(where i sometimes wrongly assume everyone on reddit is from).   ianal and all that, but i'm pretty sure the pda, ada, title vii and many of the discrimination acts only apply to companies over 15 employees(states can also choose to have similar laws apply to smaller employers  as well though). it also wouldn't be illegal to ask, just illegal for a larger company to discriminate based on the answer(so a proper company would heavily advise interviewers against asking about pregnancy/religion/etc) and wouldn't be eligible for traditional discriminatory retaliation for a 2/3 person company. review websites and the like would probably be as far as you could go with it.",blank,,
dfkbrsj,t1_dfk4ajy,35,"i'm not in the usa, so none of those laws/acts apply to me. in the netherlands, there are no exceptions on discriminating if you're only a small company. it is also absolutely illegal to ask here. any potential employer is specifically *only* allowed to ask questions that help them determine if you'd be good for the job.",blank,,
