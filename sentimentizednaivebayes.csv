t3_3nf53v,113,"in my experience (in the uk, as a female tech ""consultant"" which has included being a programmer, project manager, business analyst, and genuine consultant for the past 3 years), i can give a few observations. obviously these are all anecdotal from my experience only.  * it's commented upon semi regularly, like ""oh, you should speak to this person, they are a strong advocate for woman in technology"", or "" oh, you don't see many very technical women"" etc. some people (anecdotally, older people) say this kind of thing more often, and others not at all. i always find it a bit weird to have people talk about it, because it doesn't really affect my day to day. * in terms of pay/promotion, there is some kind of "" understanding"" that women are promoted/hired more easily, for diversity reasons, and this leads to a scepticism of women's abilities while doing the actual job. this means people assume i am over promoted/underqualified because of my gender (but also to be fair maybe my age as well). for example when i was discussing my next promotion with a colleague they said ""well, you don't want people to think you just got it because you're a woman"". so, there are pros and cons there, and i don't feel too bad about it because if i'm good enough to do the job then i don't mind overcoming initial scepticism , and getting any preference on promotions/hiring is not a bad thing on an individual basis (even if i wish the system didn't treat gender as a factor) * my work with indian development teams always comes with some caveat that the male developers will not respect me. i have found this true often initially, but after i have shown that i am technically competent then they generally get over that. (also i have worked with indian teams where it is not true at all, and indian teams with a close to 50/50 gender balance). i have worked with indian teams where male developers will be outright rude to female developers,  and this is a bit more frequent than i would accept as random chance of having rude people in the team. * there is a whole lot of support available for women/mothers in technology, which i guess in itself is a bit discriminatory as why should it be specific to gender? but, as per my previous comment on the pros and cons, it's nice that it's there if you need it.

t1_crs2pqq,208,"this is where we start to disagree thoroughly. if you think it's as easy to be a woman in tech as it is to be a man, and that what you look like as a person has no bearing on how people treat you or what game you're playing, you're just plain wrong. in life, whether you're fat or skinny, attractive or unattractive, black or asian or chicana or white etc. all changes how people treat you even if it's not in terms of overt discrimination. in some cases, you can do something about it, and in others you can't.   i suspect many women wish they could will away the way they are treated, say it's just all in their head. but it's not. i've seen it happen firsthand, i've seen sexual harassment, i've seen their identity brought up repeatedly for them without them doing it actively or wanting it brought up. it's the ""oh wow, you're a girl and you're in this space"" mentality and it and its logical consequences are *pervasive*. i strongly feel that the only way someone could feel like it's in their heads and that they're psychologically primed to think this way is if they genuinely haven't put themselves in a woman's shoes, not *really*.  and not all guys have experienced the same problem, not in the same way. i have seen guys complain about this sort of stuff when they're self-educated, and they rightfully bring up that they think it's because of their background. no one gives them shit for coming to those conclusions, and good advice is offered.",negative,negative
