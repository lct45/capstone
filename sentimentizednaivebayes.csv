t1_crs0b20,208,"there is no good foolproof way to hire people for the incredibly complex kinds of skillsets we deal with  right. so economically, you should prioritize identifying bad hires quickly (in much the same way you prioritize failing quickly with the code you write). you can't do that if you're giving them little unimportant tasks.   on things that aren't priority tickets.  everything is a priority ticket. i don't know what your workflow looks like, but on my team, we only work on the highest priority stuff. pulling things out that are low priority just for a new person to work on is going to actively give the impression that they're not trusted as a developer. sure, if you've got someone who's never used git before, you might pull out a bug in the login form or something, but the purpose there is to teach them git, not ""get them acquainted with the code base"".    giving a new person a priority ticket as work to do and then needing to backstep on that assignment is a waste.  you're going to have to help that person with questions and code reviews no matter what they work on, so it makes sense to allow that thing to be impactful so that (a) they're able to see their own contributions and (b) they're able to be broadly exposed to the code base as soon as possible.   hence why any competent team will give new hires small tasks to do while they learn the codebase and ask questions, then ease them into larger contributions.  as someone who manages a software team, i've had nothing but wild success giving people bigger tasks than they're expecting or think they're ready for early on in their employment. when i check in with them after they get it merged to master, the response is universally ""i didn't think i was ready for that, but there was lots of support and it turns out i'm farther along than i thought i was"". i don't do this on the first day, but it's usually within the first week. it helps us identify their strengths and weaknesses and build on that success going forward.   i get that you're really interested in playing the social justice game, but this is not a social justice issue, it is a management issue.  there's no difference between those things. treating people well is a core part of good management.",negative,positive

(i say normal in quotes because while obviously nothing is wrong with wearing a head-covering, it's just less expected than usual.)   i liken a situation like this to asking for vacation or special treatment early in the interview process. sure, sometimes you need to say things like, ""one month after my start date, i have a two-week family vacation i need to go on"" or ""i need to leave early every monday to take my kid to soccer"", but you don't usually mention them on the first interview. you usually wait until you've accepted the offer, because you don't want anything to get in the way of them loving you and offering you the position. in the end, you wearing a head-covering at work will be no issue (at any reasonable company), but you don't want anything stopping you from getting in the door.",negative,negative

t3_4fievg,114,"black male game programmer here. 6 years developing generally, 1+ in the game industry.   i am a black female nearing the end of my high school education and i am taking interest in becoming a software engineer or a computer hardware engineer.   do it! we need more women in stem fields. you folks invented programming, damn it. take it back!   i'm wondering how often i will meet people of my same gender or race in the cs workplace.   it depends on what counts. i've met black people, male and female, at every job i've had. managers? game designers? artists? qa testers? sure, there are a few. i have met a black *software engineer* exactly **once**, not counting the handful (4) that were in my graduating class.    if you are a black or female developer, can you please share your experience?  the only black guy on the team, every job. by team, i mean the 5-15 people i interact with on a daily basis. occasionally i might meet/talk to other black people, but that's typically outside the scope of work, and typically the other guy is not a programmer.    are women and minorities treated differently?  i honestly couldn't say. i don't think so, but given that a lot of the problems we face manifest themselves outside the context of where they'd be obvious, i'd say there's a good chance i've had some issue ultimately (unknowingly) caused by race.    how often do you see these kinds of people?  not sure what you're asking. the people that treat us differently?  i mean, the biggest hurdle we face is the institutional/societal one that comes into play long before we start submitting job applications. it's when *literally* *all* the black people you see doing well in life are either athletes or entertainers. and popular/critically-acclaimed black films are almost always about slavery. it's a god damned shame, and it's also the reason why so few women/minorities end up in this field.   growing up, when i decided that i wanted to work in the game industry, i did so because i was too stupid to notice that no other black people were doing it. if i'm being honest, i probably also noticed that everyone who wasn't japanese was also ""breaking into"" the industry.   edit: you know what? i just remembered that at my last job, someone on my team second-guessed literally everything i did for several months, until it became painfully obvious that i was competent, and he stopped. i was never around him enough to notice if he treated anyone else that way. to this day, i don't know if that was a racial thing, or what. but it wasn't like i screwed up something easy early on; i was just always treated like that by him.   are startups or big companies more likely to have women and minorities?  i couldn't tell you. pretty much no matter where you work, you'll see a ton of white dudes. maybe a few hispanics. you'll probably be the only black person. the other women, if any, will be white.   though, from what i understand, the large companies (facebook, google, etc.) tend to have a ton of foreign developers on work visas, so that's a thing. i don't know it firsthand, though.   i've been hearing a lot of terrible stories of how black people can be treated poorly and it is very difficult to keep myself from switching what career i want to be.  what i've personally noticed is that white people, unless they're actually racist, tend to try hard not to say/do racist things. they don't wanna be ""that guy."" occasionally, you'll end up working with ""that guy,"" and it sucks. but mostly, it's fine, and people are cool.  you just have to be okay with being the only black person in the room. and okay with not causing too much friction when ""that guy"" says some sideways shit, then looks directly at the local ambassador of the black federation. it helps that race is a federally protected class in the us, so it's job-affecting-level shit if someone screws up along those lines.",negative,negative
