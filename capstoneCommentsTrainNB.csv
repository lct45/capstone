crrnyaz,t3_381e1k,208,"man, i wish you had asked this question on a forum that isn't populated mostly by dudes. please don't feel discouraged by the people questioning whether gender has anything to do with your problems - it is really, really easy to not notice a problem when it doesn't affect you.  sadly, the only thing i can tell you to do is to work hard and be so good they can't ignore it. it sucks, but it's kind of just how things work in this industry at the moment. you also have to be really delicate about people's egos. don't correct other people publicly, don't actively try to one-up people, and don't get personal when it comes to technical disagreements. programmers can be super fragile when it comes to intelligence, and if you make someone feel like an idiot, they are going to resent you for it, a lot. i like what one of the other commenters said - instead of straight up telling someone they're wrong, try to ask them a question or otherwise guide them in a direction that will let them see their own mistake.  secondly, if you get to a point where you honestly feel like you are not respected at your job and there is no future for advancement - leave. you have skills that are in high demand and frankly, you don't have to put up with that shit. there are many companies that are committed to diversity and have cultures that are accepting, but there are many more that are not, and those companies are not going to change. find a place to work where you feel valued - it makes such a big difference.  lastly, if you live near a city, try to connect with other women engineers. i used to feel kind of alone and alienated, but i got involved with the local women in tech scene, and spending time around other women who are smart, talented, and successful really helped my own confidence. it's great to have other women to talk to about career advice. on reddit, i recommend /r/girlsgonewired!",positive

crrqtfe,t3_381e1k,208,"hi op, sorry to hear about your troubles.  i'm a guy, so keep that in mind.   problem is, people assume you have no idea what you're doing, until you prove them wrong. (i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let matt handle this.)  i joined my current company last year and i feel the same way about my workplace. everyone else has a few more years experience at this company and a lot more overall years of experience. i haven't had this issue in any other job before. so what i'm suggesting is that you have gotten a bad group of people like myself and it may not be a gender thing, although that is how it might feel. (i don't know either way, just suggesting that there are alternative issues maybe).   and then even after that, if i happen to do something faster/cleaner than someone, the reply i often get is something along the lines of 'wow you did it faster. i must have really fucked up.'  this to me at least sounds like an issue of the new person making the old person look bad. in any case this is a really shitty thing to do. you could take something like this to heart and get upset about it, or you could joke around with them and not let it bother you. this will do a couple things, it will show them you won't let their comments bother you, it will also show them that you are their to work and threaten their positions in the company(depending on how they take it). you don't have to be a jerk or mean or anything, just throw light jabs that will bruise them or embarrass them.    there have been several cases where they were wrong, and i said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because i should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.  depending on when and how you correct them it could piss them off easily. if you are in a meeting with everyone on your team and you point out even the obvious mistake, this would embarrass that person easily. the trick is to point out the mistake, not lay blame though. this may be easier said then done. your wording is key as well, don't go hey sam you made a mistake here and i corrected it. it should be softer like, i was fixing this problem and i found something that i thought could be written like this and changed it. or something to that affect. its not a mistake you corrected, its a better way of doing it.   so the question is, how do i get past that people who don't know me immediately assume i don't know what i'm doing, and how do i be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?  i completely believe you when you say you are feeling gender related issues, i saw it in school, i see it in my current workplace. however i think the issues you describe are parts a) level of experience and b) ass-hole co-workers.  if you arn't asserting yourself as an expert when you speak, your body language etc. then people will see the opportunity to walk over you.   just speak with confidence, have research to back you up if you think its needed, do your work as good as you can.  be ready to take the hits sometimes and when you see the opportunity be ready to give them out. again, you don't need to be malicious about it.  lastly,   for clarity, 'matt' joined around the same time (a month later than i did), but there was more confidence in him and other guys who started around the same time  does matt have more real world experience then you? is his education university while yours is college? is matt bonding better with his co workers then you? does his job naturally involve more complicated and complex work then yours?  there are a billion reasons why matt might be treated better then you or anyone else on your group. you need to think about what the differences are between you two. gender is one, probably small issue of that.   i got treated very poorly at my old job because everyone else on the floor had bachelor degrees (or higher) and i had a college degree and pretty fresh at that. i turned that around through my attitude and work. you can close some gaps in the workplace, its a matter of identifying each persons issue with you and addressing it.   hope any of that helps you.",negative

(i.e. it's a high priority feature. we're going to let matt handle this.)  it takes a while for people to trust you - you have to prove yourself constantly, not just once, for a while, to get ""automatic respect"" in this sense. as for matt having it, it could that he has a better background  (more years of experience before you, worked at a larger company, etc) so some people might put more weight on that, like having an ex-googler or fb engineer on the staff vs. a bunch of recent graduates with no much experience - even if they started at the same time in the company, a manager will put more trust on whoever has more experience. with that, that can level out, if you perform well.   'wow you did it faster. i must have really fucked up.'  that could be interpreted in two ways (depends on the tone of voice and the person) so i can't judge it - it could be a condescending comment (like ""i must have really fucked up if even you were able to do it faster"") or it could be a self-deprecating comment (""you were able to do this much faster than i could - i must've really missed something very obvious"").   there's another experienced (female) se who's really good at what she does, and i've noticed that people are condescending towards her sometimes too.. (mocking her for little things)  again depends on tone - se is a boy's club, for better or for worse, and this little mocking and condescension is common even among males, specially if there's a friendly atmosphere. in a way, the more you're mocked (if playfully) the more you're belonging to the group. you know how men will mock and curse at each other but it's all play? this could be it, but more subtle.    problem is, there's always some indignation and resentment if i happen to do something faster or correct someone. there have been several cases where they were wrong, and i said something (in the gentlest manner possible, because i should know that by now), and still, they get pissed off.  then it's their fault they can't handle their ego getting hurt - just keep doing your thing and doing it well and you'll be respected in time, even if they don't show it in a way you might expect.   so the question is, how do i get past that people who don't know me immediately assume i don't know what i'm doing  you don't - people will tend to assume you don't know what you're doing by default, unless you are a very very nerd-looking asian with a ti-84 in your shirt's pocket, or you come with some pre-selection (like another trusted engineer in the team vouching for you and saying you're great). it's just how humans are wired and process stereotypes - we're still not used to seeing woman in cs, let alone women that are *great* at it. just give it time and keep giving your best and you'll prove yourself over time. cs is a meritocracy, so you have to earn your merit, it is not given to you by default for no particular reason... so just keep doing what you're doing.  a great way to break the ""taboo"" too is to get a big project (like the one they gave ""matt"") where people doubt you can make it - then you go and make it brilliantly. you won't be doubted a second time, and if you are, you can refer to the *big project* that you did as reference, then there won't be a third time.   and how do i be a strong performer without coworkers getting pissed off?  that's a tricky one. it is not a gender thing and it is - men will get pissed when their egos get hurt because another guy did something amazingly better than them... and it can hurt extra if they are outperformed by a woman (just like it would extra suck for a man to lose at arm wrestling to a girl). you can't control other people's emotions, but you can keep doing your thing and eventually they will adapt and get used to it and quit getting pissed. it's not your fault they're getting pissed, it's their own problem (due to their ego) so there isn't much that you can do.  what i would do in your shoes is try to show them you're not out to get them or [explicitly] compete with them - for example, tell one of your coworkers that you would like their opinion on something. show them a problem you have and the solution you came up with and ask their opinion, if they think it will perform well, if they can think of a way for it to perform better, etc. this will tell them you are not out to compete, but that you're not helpless either because you're not asking for *help*, you already solved the problem, you're just asking their *opinion* - this puts both of you on level ground, as equals, and also shows them that you value their opinion and that you are looking to collaborate, not compete... then thank them for their input and that's it. just make sure your solution is actually really good (so he won't scratch the whole thing out and come up with something much better) or it can backfire (make you out to be incompetent).",negative

(also i have worked with indian teams where it is not true at all, and indian teams with a close to 50/50 gender balance). i have worked with indian teams where male developers will be outright rude to female developers,  and this is a bit more frequent than i would accept as random chance of having rude people in the team. * there is a whole lot of support available for women/mothers in technology, which i guess in itself is a bit discriminatory as why should it be specific to gender? but, as per my previous comment on the pros and cons, it's nice that it's there if you need it.

(btw, why do we get shit for ""talking black"", but other races or nationalities don't get shit for speaking in a foreign language?). imo i would follow my path, and speak the queen's english at first. once your coworkers see you as ""one of them"" you're done. you'll never recover.   the whole ""talking black"" thing bit me in the butt at my last job. i let my guard down a little too early and paid the price later on. i eventually got fired from that job, not because i was black, but i'm certain that me letting my guard down had something to do with it.   here's the story: you know when you first meet someone and you're very formal and stiff because you don't know the person well? well, after i let my guard down i could literally see my (white) manager's reaction go from very formal to ""hey brotha, what's goin' down?"" i really didn't like that, and i didn't like him because he was a micromanaging know-nothing that thought he was a genius. this guy was a dick, and we didn't share a sense of humor, so long story short when it came time to make a decision on my future i am certain that because he saw me as ""one of them"" the decision was easy.   as a educated black working professional you'll second-guess yourself frequently. you don't want to be that person that blames everything on racism, but what if it was. how can you tell? you'll learn over time, that's the only advice i can give you in that regard.   i would recommend trying to find a mentor that shares your background. when i got my first job out of college (not a programmer) i had some older black ladies looking out for me and trying to show me the ropes. because i was young and inexperienced i didn't really understand the gravity of what they were trying to do for me. they warned me about some people and gave me advice. listen to your mentor's advice.    this has been long and rambling, and i don't really care to proofread or edit b/c i have to get back to work now. if you need clarification or extra details comment below and i'll be happy to reply.",negative
